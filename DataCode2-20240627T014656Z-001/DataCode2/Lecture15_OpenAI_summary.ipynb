            "Summary:\n",
            " Variations in Soil Blue. Blue Carbon Sequestration between Natural.Mangrove Metapopulations and a Mixed Mangrove Plantation: A Case Study from the World’s Largest Contiguous. Contiguous Mangroves Forest. Life.2023 ,13, 271.\n",
            " Sundarban is the world’s largest mangrove wetland . This study, conducted in 2016, to compare blue carbon sequestration with different natural metapopulations and a four-year-old marina . The aims of the study is to ﬁnd out the variations in soil ecological function (pH) and key ecological service indicator (soil blue carbon pool) between sites .\n",
            " Index revealed that all the sites are under ecological stress . pH and electrical conductivity were highest in Suaeda maritima and Phoenixpadulosa -dominated metapopulations . Organic carbon was the highest under the mangrove plantation and Avicennia marina -dominated site .\n",
            " Mangroves are specially adapted plant groups that have a physiological, morpho-centriclogical, or anatomical adaptation to survive and proliferate in saline tide washed soil and mud . Indonesia has the largest area under the man-grove cover scattered across the tropical islands, but the ‘Sundarban mangrove wetland’ is the world’s largest contiguous area .\n",
            " Sundarban ecosystem is a repository of the sediment organic carbon content, varying between 0.92 to 3.29%, resulting in an organic carbon stock of 59.14 Tg within 90 cm of the intertidal sediment . Mangrove and sea grasses constitutes the blue carbon sink, which is larger than most of the terrestrial ecosystems, such as boreal forests and tropical forest types .\n",
            " 54 out of 102 islands at the Indian part of Sundarbans were un-improved human habitation and mangrove forests had been wiped out . The rest of the islands were conserved and the last remaining frontier for enigmatic Royal Bengal Tigers . However, blue carbon stocks are reducing across the Sundarban mangroves ecosystem .\n",
            " Restoration initiatives have also increased in these islands to protect the mudflats and embankments from erosion during natural disasters . Blue carbon is the key tool in the hand of climate change ecologists against the fight with global warming . Restoration initiatives are known to improve the blue carbon pool [3].\n",
            " The study area has been selected at different parts of Indian Sundarbans with different forests/plantation, as natural mangrove community sites . Descriptions and locations of the study sites have been elucidated in Table 1 and Figure 1 . The location of the plant layers with respect to High Tide Level (HTL) and Low Tide Level has been depicted in Figure 2 .\n",
            " Samplings and biodiversity survey have been conducted on 2016 (Post-monsoon). The site is devoid of human intervention or plantation program . The community ecology of the mangrove metapopulation was liable to change under natural influences . Five quadrat plots (10 m  10 m) were randomly set in the site each year .\n",
            " The study site is an association between naturally grown A. marina and R. mucronata . The patch is dominated by Avicennia marina . The area is in a creek locally called ‘Dutta River’.\n",
            " Table 1 shows the location and description of the study sites/metapopulation . The study site is an association be-giantween naturally grown A. marina and planted R. mu-phthalcronata . The plantation comprises of Rhizophora mucronata , exe-cuted in 2012 .\n",
            " The study site is in a creek locally called ‘Dutta River’ It has a 60% Relative density for Avicennia marina,  while Son-glyneretia caseolaris constitute another 20% . The patch is dominated by A. marina .\n",
            " The location of the plant layers with respect to High Tide Le vel (HTL) and Low Tide Level (LTL) line has been depicted in Figure 2.2.1 . Site-1: Rhizophora mucronata have been planted through the drain and trench method to maximize the survival of the nursery grown saplings [3]. Site-2–5: Natural degraded mudflats near to t. lationdominated by halophyte- S. maritima .\n",
            " Samplings and  biodiversity survey have been conducted on 2016 (Post-monsoon) Samplings were conducted on a plantation site with about 70%  mudflat covered with a particular mangrove or halophyte species . The site is devoid of human intervention or pl antation program .\n",
            " The distribution or dispersion of a indi vidual species is generally estimated as;  Percentage Percentage Percentage of occurrence . The species diversity of the sites was assessed through Relative density and Frequency Frequency . The study was based on previous research on community ecology at the Indian Sundarbans .\n",
            " An acid washed trowel was used to scoop out the soil from upper surface of the mud (0–30 cm) soil . The sites were selected, keeping in mind the similarity of anthropogenic stresses at all sites (to negate the biasness of the data) and to cover maximum types of maul .\n",
            " In the plantation sites, soil samples were collected from the four corners of ten 5 m                 5 m quadrat quadrat . Approximately 30% of the area was under the cover of A. marina, while the rest of the 70% was under R. mucronata plantation .\n",
            " Plant-available nitrogen (N) was estimated after digesting samples with 0.32% KMnO 4solution followed by titration with N H 2SO4 . Plant available Phosphorus was determined by the Olsen method [14]. Carbon pool (0–10 cm) was calculated using SOC concentration, bulk density, and soil depth [15]\n",
            " Simpson’s Index of Dominance (D) is used to quantify the ‘entropy’ or ‘randomness’ in a community, which sheds light onto the overall health of an ecosystem . The ‘Diversity’ value of the dominance estimator is the diversity of the ecosystem .\n",
            " The data was analysed using Microsoft Excel 2007 and SPSS 16 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). The regression analysis was used to understand the trends in temporal changes in salinity regime and biodiversity . The biodiversity assessment in the sites revealed an array of species composition .\n",
            " Relative density (RD) and Frequency (F)occupancy of species have been represented in the table . At some sites the total RD value may be above or less than ‘100’ The values have been ‘approximated’ to nearnest integer .\n",
            " The health of ecosystems in all the ﬁve sites has been elucidated by Simpson’s Index of Dominance and Diversity, and the information-statistic index-Shannon Weiner-Weiner Index (Table 3) The results depicted in Table 4 indicate that these parameters are statistically and signiﬁcantly varying .\n",
            " Sand Silt Clay pH SOC (%) BD (g/cm3)P (mg/kg)Salinity (ppt)N (mg) is analysed using Duncan’s Multiple Range Tests (DMRT) Site 1 has a 24 RD for A. marina, while it has an RD of 60 for R. mucronata (planted species) Plantation location (Site 1 or S1) has a . 24 RD value for a marina . Plantation . 1 site has a. 24 RD .\n",
            " Site-2 (S2) has an 80 RD value for A. marina, indicating its dominance in the natural environment . Site-3 has a 48 RD for the species, while S. caseolaris is recorded to be at 16 . A. ilicifolius have a RD of 24, but it is a small thorny herb and a mangrove associate (semelparous species)\n",
            " Site-3 (S3) has an association of two iteroparous tree species . Site-4 (S4) has a dominance of the edaphic sub-climax species and mangrove palm and shrub, P . paludosa (RD = 63) The rest of the species have a sparce distribution .\n",
            " Site-5 (S5) has a dominance of only a salt tolerant ruderal semelparous herb- S.                maritima (RD = 69) The rest of the species has been sparsely distributed in the study site . This species is highly adapted to soil salinity and oxy-generationation stress .\n",
            " The distance from the nearest conserved mangrove population and observed species number at the sites indicates that geological forcing of en-vironmental parameters may be more important for the species distribution of mangroves . The island biogeography theory at Indian Sundarbans does not conclu-ve sites do not disprove the island .\n",
            " Site-3 with aLife2023 ,13, 271 8 of 11 species- R. mucronata . The Shannon-Weiner Index shows a higher comparative value compared to other natural sites . Sites (4 and 5) under erosional or .ajoast stress and with only dominant semelparous herbs, had the lowest diversity value and . the lowest randomness or entropy amongst all the iversity habitats .\n",
            " The pH of all the sites varied signiﬁcantly and was recorded within the alkaline range . pH of hypersaline mangrove wetlands always tends to be alkaline due to the presence of basic ions of Na, K, Ca and Mg . S1 have the highest proportion of clay, while S3 have more silt and S4 have highest sand proportion .\n",
            " S4, S5 indicates the formation of ‘saline blanks’ on the surface of the soil . This typically occurs when a particular soil has been devoid of biodiversity cover, and that results in the deposition of salt from lower depths of soil through capillary action . Both S4 and S5 has been observed to have saline blanks .\n",
            " All mangroves are evergreen plants that shed leaves throughout the year, unlike deciduous plants . The leaf litter constitutes for increased nutrient-N,P in the soil . The highest N is recorded in S3 because of the association between two mangrove tree species— A. marina and S. caseolaris .\n",
            " The blue carbon pool was found to be highest in the plantation site (S1), followed by S2 with more than 10–15-year-old A. marina strands . The association of the two species and the colonization of the other mangrove species indicates an approximately better ecological health, but a Shannon-Weiner value less than 1.5 for all the sites does indicate a stressed ecosystem that is in need of conservation interventions .\n",
            " All mangroves are evergreen plants that sh ed leaves throughout the year, unlike deciduous plants . The litter co nstitutes for increased nutrient-N,P in the soil . The blue carbon pool was found to be highest in the plantation site (S1), followed by  S2 with S1 .\n",
            " The average soil organic carbon stock and N for the top 1 m soils has been observed to be 263 ± 14 Mg C ha−1 and 11.8 ± 0.4 Mg N ha −1 at eastern Brazilian mangroves [29]. A restoration initiative at Xiamen, China, revealed that the 10-year-old Sonneratia apetala  and Kandelia obovata  plantations have a C-sequestration rate of 3.32  ± 0.62 C m−2 yr−1 [30].\n",
            " Multispecies strands and restoration initiatives improve carbon sequestration in soil compared to degraded mud under the dominance of stress tolerant semelparous halophytes or mangrove associates . The average soil organic carbon stock and N for the top 1 m soils has been observed to be 263  14 Mg C ha. gure 3.8 Mg N ha.1 at easternBrazilian mangroves .\n",

            "Summary:\n",
            " The Global Mangrove Watch is a new 2010 Global Baseline of Mangroves Extent . The study was conducted by Pete Bunting, Ake Rosenqvist, Richard M. Lucas, Lisa-Maria Rebelo and L. Lammert Hilarides .\n",
            " This study presents a new global baseline of mangrove extent for 2010 and has been released as the first output of the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) initiative . This is the first study to apply a globally consistent and automated method for mapping mangroves .\n",
            " Asia has the highest proportion of mangroves with 38.7% of the global total, while Latin America and the Caribbean have 20.3%, Africa has 20.0%, Oceania has 11.9%, North America has 8.4% and the European Overseas Territories have 0.7%.\n",
            " A minimum mapping unit of 1 ha is recommended and that the error increases in regions of disturbance and where narrow-strips or smaller fragmented areas of mangroves are present . Artefacts due to cloud cover and the Landsat-7 SLC-off error are also present in some areas .\n",
            " Through population increases, industrialisation, urban expansion and globalisation, mangroves have been fragmented or degraded . Mangroves are receiving greater recognition for their role in food provision, coastal protection, reserves of biodiversity and as a large carbon store .\n",
            " A fundamental requirement for mangrove protection and restoration is information about current and historical distributions and conditions . Data is critical for informing efforts that support conservation, sustainable management, and restoration of these ecosystems . The FAO have also conducted surveys to estimate global mangroves for 1980, 1990 and 2000 .\n",
            " The maps generated are historical (currently by at least two decades) and are unable to be easily updated and certainly not on a regular (e.g., annual) basis . Rates of mangrove loss can also then not be determined as products from different years are based on different years .\n",
            " The Global Mangrove Watch(GMW) aimed to produce consistent 25 m spatial resolution maps of mangrove extent across their range by generating a baseline map for 2010 . The mapping was confined to locations with conditions considered suitable to support mangroves . The objective of the GMW is to provide the information needed by a wide range of users .\n",
            " Many studies have used Earth Observation (EO) data to map mangrove extent . At a global level, the study of Giri et al. [1]was the first to consider L-band SAR for global assessment of mangroves .\n",
            " Methods adopted have varied . The majority have used Landsat and SAR data, while a few have fused optical data . A significant gap is the lack of studies that have sought to develop and apply a single consistent methodology that is repeatable over large gis .\n",
            " The new global mangrove baseline has been generated using a combination of Synthetic Aperture-Radar (SAR) from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased-Array L-band SyntheticAperture Radar (PALSAR) and optical satellite data from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and ETM+ .\n",
            " Using data acquired in 2010, a baseline map of mangrove extent was generated by integratingALOS PALSAR and a composite of Landsat sensor data and referencing the 2000 Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) 30 m Digital Elevation Model data . A final quality assurance (QA) of the resulting baseline product was then taken through visual assessment and, where appropriate, errors were corrected .\n",
            " A global ocean regions dataset was derived to identify oceanic water bodies . The shoreline dataset was rasterised onto the same pixel grid as the ALOS PALSAR data . Oceanic water was defined as pixels that were 200 pixels ( \u00185000 m) from the defined shoreline .\n",
            " The data was re-sampled or rasterised onto the same 0.8 arc-second pixel grid as the ALOS PALSAR data . For the SRTM data cubic spline interpolation was used, while for other continuous data (e.g., Landsat) a cubic convolution was applied .\n",
            " The ALOS PALSAR dual polarisation (HH+HV) backscatter data used were provided by JAXA and Landsat Composites . The nominal spatial resolution was 25 m (0.8 arc seconds) and data were provided in the WGS84 (EPSG:4326) coordinate system . The mosaics are openly available in the public domain .\n",
            " composite images were generated using Landsat sensor data acquired for 2010 . This was particularly the case for certain types of adjoining terrestrial forests and wetlands with similar structure to mangroves . Mangroves were distinct from many of these land covers within the Landsat data .\n",
            " A total of 15,346 Landsat scenes from 1766 row/paths were downloaded using the Google Cloud API (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/public-datasets/landsat) The images were processed to surface reflectance, cloud masked and topographically corrected using the “Atmospheric and Radiometric Correction of Satellite Imagery’s software .\n",
            " Landsat data were re-sampled to match the 0.8 arc-second pixel grid of the ALOS PALSAR data . A maximum NDVI compositing [ 40,41] processing chain was then applied using RSGISLib [ 25] to generate a single Landsat composite image .\n",
            " The resulting 128 projects were defined by the union of Giri et al. [1]and Spalding et. [2]datasets . The resulting groups were then assessed, with small or large regions merged into larger regions and large regions split when these were deemed too large for computational processing .\n",
            " Remote Sens. 2018,10, 1669 6 of 19. Researchers used a per-pixel Extremely Randomized Trees classification using Scikit-Learn [ 27] and RSGISLib [ 25] software . An initial water mask was produced us us .\n",
            " A coastal region was defined as the area 20 pixels ( \u0018500 m) on either side of the shoreline with a bathymetry depth of >  100m . Additional regions based on 80 pixels ( ++2000 m) either side and a water occurrence < 80were added to this mask . 100,000 training pixels were then extracted randomly for land and water .\n",
            " The thresholds used for generating the coastal mask were identified through an iterative sensitivity analysis and by visually assessing the resulting maps . Water regions with an area of < 50pixels ( \u001831,250 m2) were assigned to the water class .\n",
            " The distance from the coastal water mask needed to be less than 110% of the 99th percentile of the distance of the mangrove pixels . Within the region defined above, a classification was subsequently performed . The classification was performed using the Extremely Randomized Trees classifier, with 100 estimators .\n",
            " The new baseline was classified in two independent steps: first using the ALOS PALSAR and then using Landsat data . The mangrove habitat layer (to be available at http://www.globalmangrovewatch.org) defines the maximum possible extent of habitat .\n",
            " The classification was undertaken using the Extremely Randomized Trees classifier . The input variables were ALOS PALSAR HH and HV data (transformed to log unit dB), the ratio of HH/HV, pixel longitude and latitude and the mangrove probability . Training samples were defined through random sampling where 100,000 mangroves and non-mangrove samples were used .\n",
            " The training points were visually checked and edited with reference to Google Earth Imagery as well as the ALOS PALSAR and Landsat sensor imagery . In total, 20 M training points globally were defined globally . The region outside the habitat mask, within which training samples were selected, was defined as < 150pixels ( \u00183750 m) from the . union of the mangrove products .\n",
            " An extensive quality assurance (QA) process was carried out following an automated analysis . The resulting analysis was compiled into a single global product for 2010 on a global product . The Extremely Randomized Trees classifier was applied to generate the final classification .\n",
            " The product was visually checked against the ALOS PALSAR and Landsat sensor data as well as contemporary (2010) Google Earth imagery . Where significant errors of omission and commission were identified, polygons were drawn and edits applied . The accuracy assessm. undertaken .\n",
            " The accuracy assessment was undertaken using a customQGIS plugin that guides the operator to each point, providing a simple interface to decide between classes . The imagery used for reference included high resolution Google Earth imagery, custom high-resolution imagery, GMW Landsat image composites and ALOS PALSAR 2010 data .\n",
            " Asia is estimated to account for 38.7% of the world’s mangroves, with Southeast Asia alone 294% . Southeast Asia is the region w.2% (32.2%) of the mangrove . The Americas are estimated to comprise 28.7%, Africa and 295.0% Oceania .\n",
            " Indonesia contains the 297. ith largest area of mangroves (53,278 km2) with Latin America and the Caribbean (previously referred to 298-298) having the similar amounts . Brazil, Australia and Mexico combined contain 22.3% of the world's mangrove .\n",
            " The resulting baseline map gives an estimated total mangrove area in 2010 of 137,600 km2 . Asia is estimated to account for 38.7% of the world’s mangroves, with Southeast Asia alone representing almost a third . The Americas are estimated to comprise 28.7%, and Africa and Oceania 20.0% and 11.9% .\n",
            " Indonesia contains 19.5% of the world's mangroves . Brazil, Australia and Mexico combined contain 22.3% of mangrove areas . The Neotropics region (27,940 km2) and Africa has similar amounts . The accuracy of the classification was 95.3%, with a 99% likelihood that the confidence interval was 4.5–5.0% .\n",
            " GMW mangrove baseline for 2010 and distribution of mangroves in longitude and latitude(WGS-84; epsg:4326) The most common errors observed within the GMW baseline are associated with fine-scale features (e.g., riverine, aquaculture and fine coastal features)\n",
            " Remote Sens. 2018,10, 1669 11 of 19: A recommended minimum mapping unit of 1 ha (i.e., 8 pixels) for reliable mapping is considered to be the most appropriate for end users . The minimum feature size of objects identifiable within the ALOS PALSAR and Landsat sensor data encompassed multiple pixels .\n",
            " The backgroundimagery is the 2010 Landsat composite generated for this study, visualised using the NIR, SWIR and Red wavelength bands . The comparison between the GMW 2010 baseline and the 2000 Giri et al. [1] and Spalding et. [2] datasets was undertaken for the six Ramsar regions .\n",
            " Riau/Jambi in Sumatra, Indonesia: GMW v2.0 baseline; (B) Giri et al. [1] and (C) Spalding et. [2] products demonstrated significant differences between these two products . These differences are, in part, due to errors and missing regions in the products .\n",
            " Spalding et al. [2] often overestimates the overall mangrove extent, although there are also regions of missing data . Oceania region accounts for 7.7% of the world’s mangroves, compared to 11.9% that is denoted in this study .\n",
            " Figures for the region were calculated from datasets downloaded from the UN Ocean Data Viewer (http://data.unep-ishlywcmc.org) Giri et al. [1] (v1.3; released 2015) and Spalding et. [2 ] (v2.0; released 2017)\n",
            " The GMW v2.0 baseline and the Giri et al. [1]product has more detail than the GMW .0 baseline . The Spalding et . [2]product is generalised and overestimates the extent of mangroves in Nicaragua .\n",
            " Our results have yielded an updated global mangrove baseline, with an accuracy in excess of 90% . This new global baseline represents an improvement on existing global maps . This includes the successful mapping of mangroves for areas that were found to be absent in other existing products (e.g., Figure 7)\n",
            " The majority of mangrove area can be found in Asia, with an approximately equal proportion distributed between Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean . Mangrove baseline was derived using publicly open imagery from the ALOS PALSAR and the Landsat sensors .\n",
            " The study has produced a new baseline of global mangrove extent for 2010 . The date of the baseline was driven by the availability of the ALOS PALSAR data . The availability of Landsat data in 2010 is poor with Landsat 5 TM data not available globally, with particular sparsity of data throughout Africa .\n",
            " The 2010 Landsat Composite generated for this study is visualised using the NIR, SWIR and Red wavelength bands . The updated baseline is able to suit the requirements and needs of policy and decision makers, such as wetland managers, government bodies, civil society users and Ramsar Convention contracting parties .\n",
            " The Global Mangrove Watch map represents the extent and distribution for 2010, but is also a baseline from which a monitoring system can be built . Thomas et al. [22]demonstrated a novel “map-to-image” method to update mangrove baselines .\n",
            " The new GMW v2.0 baseline constitutes an ideal basis for such a monitoring system using the Japanese JERS-1 SAR (ca. 1996) and ALOS PALSAR (2007–2010) imagery . Data availability is expected to continue and increase into the future .\n",
            " A minimum mapping unit of 1 ha (i.e., 8 pixels) for reliable mapping was used and advocated . Errors associated with the minimum feature size are particularly evident in areas of disturbance, such as around aquaculture ponds . Future work should focus on determining an optimal year for the production of an optical image .\n",
            " There are some areas where mangroves are known to have been omitted in this version (v2.0) of the GMW dataset, due to satellite data unavailability, including: Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Bermuda (UK), Europa Island (France), Fiji, Fiji, Guam and Saipan (USA), Kiribati, Maldives, Peru (south of latitude S4) and Wallis and Futuna Islands (France) While these are not significant in terms of mangrove extent globally, they will be included in the release of future GMW datasets .\n",
            " The launch of Sentinel-2B is considered a significant opportunity for further improvements . There are also some areas where mangroves are known to have been omitted in this version 415/2.0 of the GMW dataset, due to satellite data unavailability .\n",
            " This study is the first to establish a global baseline map of mangrove extent from Earth . It is based on a globally consistent methodology that is automated and reproducible . The map demonstrated a high degree of accuracy with a 99% accuracy . It will be included in the release of future GMW datasets .\n",
            " 38.7% of mangroves found in Asia, 20.3% in Latin America and the 433-Caribbean . 20% in Africa, 20% of Africa, 11.9% in Oceania, 8.4% in North America and 0.7 % in the European Territories . This new globally consistent baseline can form the basis of an operational mangrove monitoring system .\n",
            " The new global mangrove map demonstrated a high degree of accuracy with a 99% likelihood that the accuracy of the global map was 93.6-94.5% . The baseline has mapped around 137,600 km2 of mangroves with 38.7% found in Asia, 20.3% in Latin America and the Caribbean, 20% in Africa, 11.9% in Oceania, 8.4% in North America .\n",

            " A global predictive model of carbon in mangrove soils was published in 2014 Environ. Res. Res Lett. Lett . It was published by the University of Delaware, School of Delaware School of Marine Science and Policy, 308 Robinson Hall, Newark, DEggie19716, USA .\n",
            " Research shows that mangrove conservation may be a low-cost means of reducing CO 2emissions . Using climatological and locational data as predictors, we explore several predictive models . Using over 900 soil carbon measurements, collected in 28countries by 61 independent studies, we develop a global predictive model .\n",
            " With our predictive model, weconstruct a global dataset of estimated soil carbon concentrations and stocks on a high-resolutiongrid (5 arc min) We estimate that the global mangrove soil carbon stock is 5.00 ± 0.94 Pg C(assuming a 1 meter soil depth) and ﬁnd this stock is highly variable over space . The amount of carbon per hectare in the world ’s most carbon-rich mangroves (approximately 703 ± 38 Mg C ha                −1) is roughly a 2.6 .6 .\n",
            " Results can be used to project changes in mangrove soil carbon stocks based on changing climatologicalpredictors, e.g. to assess the impacts of climate change on mangroves . The results can also be used as a tool to assess changes in soil carbon .\n",
            " Mangroves contain three to four times the mass of carbon typically found in boreal, temperate, or upland tropical forests . Recent studies point to mangrove conservation as a potentially low-cost option for reducing CO2 emissions .\n",
            " In most mangrove areas of the world, protecting mangroves achieves emissions reductions at a lower cost than reducing emissions elsewhere in the econ-omy. Accordingly, there is growing interest in developing andimplementing market-based mechanisms such as carbon off-sets .\n",
            " A key challenge in assessing the carbon bene ﬁts from mangrove conservation is the lack of rigorous spatial estimates . Unlike other tropical forests, the bulk of carbon storage is in biomass . soil carbon comprises 49 –98% of carbon stored in the soil .\n",
            " We use data to estimate global mangrovesoil carbon concentrations (mg C cm                −3) and stocks (Pg C) on a high-resolution grid (5 arc min) Our predictive model is based on soil carbon measurements compiled in the meta-analyses by Chmura et al (2003 ) Kristensen et al . and Donato et al. combined include data from over 900 samples collected in 28 countries, which contain 64.4% of global mangouves .\n",
            " We use mangrove soil carbon measurements from meta-analyses by Chmura et al (2003), Kristensen et al . Kristensen and Donato et al study the spatial distribution of above-ground biomass . Our predictive model can be helpful in assessing the impacts of climate change onmangrove carbon storage .\n",
            " A total of 932 samples were collected in 28 countries by 61 independent studies . We convert soil carbon measurements into bulk den-sity measurements following Donato et al (2011) and Kristensen et al . We then use the soil bulk density to calculate the carbon content in g C per cubic centimeter .\n",
            " For the majority of the soil carbon data, source studies report precise locational data,i.e. latitude coordinates reported to the 0.1 of a degree, and severalvariables describing climate conditions at the sampling loca-tions, and regional indicators . The data are available in the online supplementary materials at stacksiop.org/ERL/9/104013/mmedia .\n",
            " The latitude data are used to calculate distance from the equator, which has been linked to mangrove productivity, and therefore may be an important predictor of soil carbon . Climate variables are from the WorldClim Bioclim data (Hijmans et al 2005)\n",
            " We include regional indicators, where regions are ranked according to the ten biogeographic regions for man-groves developed by Spalding et al (2010) Our model controls for the impacts of unobserved factors on carbon concentration in mangrove soils .\n",
            " Constructing a robust predictive model requires balancing the most variation in the data sample with the model ’s generalizability, i.e. Its ability to predict out of the sample (Babyak 2004 ) We evaluate the alternatives models to predict soil carbon concentrations .\n",
            " The model is estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS) We compare the parametric predictive models based on in-sample predictive power and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) We estimate several speci ﬁcations of equation (2), where certain parameters or sets of parameters are constrained to equal zero .\n",
            " ML algorithms offer an alternative to single-equation parametric predictive modeling . They involve computational learning in the model-building process . ML algorithms are especially useful in instances where the relationship between the outcome variable and thepredictors is unknown, as is the case with mangrove soilcarbon concentrations (Kristensen et al 2008 )\n",
            " The relative performance of the two ML algorithms depends on the dataset . We test the out-of-sample predictivepower of each model . We use the estimated models topredict soil carbon concentrations for observations in theremaining 31 studies for each of the 1,000 datasets and cal-culate prediction errors .\n",
            " All models were ﬁtted in MATLAB (2013)version 8.1.0.604 . We begin with a simple constant-only model showing that the mean soil car-uvebon content in our sample is 32.14 mg cm−3(min.ggie13.48 mg cm+3, and max.ggie115 mgcm+3), or approximately an average of 321 Mg (tons) C ha−1in the top meter of soil . We progressively add controls to the model and find climaticvariables are signi שּׁ�cant predictors of mangrove soil carbon .\n",
            " Figure 2(left panel) shows the mean soil carbon by region, and the 95% con ﬁdence intervals around the means . The data show that mangroves in North and Central America are some of the most carbon-rich soils .\n",
            " Model 4 outperforms all other parametric predic-tions explored here in terms of attaining the highest R-squared and lowest AIC . We select it as our preferred parametric prediction model and compare it to the two ML-ML algorithms .\n",
            " The improved ability of ML models to predict out of sample suggests that they offer distinct advantages in modeling mangrove soilcarbon . Of the two ML methods, the bag DT performs better than the boosted DT, so we select it as our preferred MLmodel .\n",
            " Parametric predictive model regression results are based on soil carbon concentration (mg C cm−3) The dependent variable is: soil carbon . The model is based on the assumption that soil carbon is carbon free carbon dioxide (mgC cm+3) An average temperature of 32.139** 31.989** (Degrees C) Average temperature of 7.229** 12.210** Average Temperature of 1.747** 5.399** Coldest quarter temperature of 1,747** Average Precipitation of 0.005** (Millimeters)\n",

            " Figure 3 maps the predicted soil carbon concentrations for the world ’s mangroves and ﬁgure 4 portrays mangrove soil carbon in Indonesia . Table 4 lists the estimated global and country-level stock for the top-20 countries . Globally, we estimate thatmangrove soils contain 5.00 ± 0.94 Pg C and that about 80.5% of the pool is contained in 20 countries .\n",
            " We estimate that the amount of carbon per hectare in the world’s most carbon-rich mangroves is roughly 2.6 ± 0.14 times that of the world ‘s most . carbon-poor mangrove soil carbon . We also ﬁnd substantial . within-country .variation in soil carbon carbon . The country with the highest average soil carbon concentration has roughly twice the . amount of soil carbon, per . hectare .\n",
            " The 20 countries with highest average soil carbon concentrations contain only 1.2% of the world’s mangroves, but as a consequence of their relatively high soil carbon, these countries account for roughly 1.5% of global mangrove soil carbon .\n",
            " Our results are con-sistent with studies that mangrove productivity increases with temperature up to a threshold . ML algorithms perform substantially better than simple parametric predictions in predicting out ofsample. Therefore, they may offer substantial gains in estimating soil carbon concentrations based on available data .\n",
            " To obtain the highest-quality predictive model given available data, we explored several predictive modelingtechniques and compared their performance along severaldimensions . As with any predictive model, the quality of the predictions depends on the quality . The possibility that soil carbon measurements oversample pristine mangrove locations is speculative about in Kristensen et al (2008 ) and Hutchinsonet al (2013)\n",
            " Researchers develop a model to predict mangrove soil carbon explaining substantial spatialvariation in the carbon concentrations of global mangroves . The relative importance normalizes the relative importance of the model by the sum of importance scores over allpredictors .\n",
            " Using over 900observations collected in 28 countries throughout the world, which represent the majority of global mangroves, we produce a high-resolution and explicitly explicit global dataset of mangrove soil carbon concentrations . These data can help examine current man-grove conservation projects .\n",
            " Mangrove carbon storage varies substantially over space; the bene ﬁts from mangrove conservation depend on the location of the mangroves conserved . This will allow for a more complete understanding of the impacts of climate change .\n",
            " Future work is needed to evaluate the full array of ecosystem services that mangroves provide, such as shoreline protection or the provision of providing nursery habitat for ﬁsh .

            " Change and fragmentation trends of Zhanjiang mangrove forests in southeastern China using multi-temporal Landsat imagery (1977 e2010) Mangrove forests are found in saline coastal environments around the tropical and subtropical coastal environments . Mangroves are among the most productive terrestrial ecosystures in the world .\n",
            " The objective of this work was to characterize the spatio-temporal changes in mangrove distribution and fragmentation patterns in the Zhanjiang NationalMangrove Forest Nature Reserve, Guangdong province of Southern China, from 1977 through 2010 . Results revealed that the mangroves' spatial extent decreased sharply during the period from 1977 to 1991 due to deforestation, particularly shrimp farming . Afterwards, there was acontinuous increase in manigrade extent from 1991 to 2010 due to affore .\n",
            " The mangrove fragmentation trends depicted by the fragmentation model had a high degree of corre-centriclation with the observed areal changes . The recorded dynamics of the local biodiversity(mainly birds) were consistent with the mangroves ecosystem fragmentation trends over time .\n",
            " Mangrove forests, found in saline coastal environ-ments around tropical and subtropical latitudes, are among the most productive terrestrial ecosystems in the world . These forests play an important role in providing ecological and societal goods and services to local communities .\n",
            " Many mangrove communities are currently being subject to disturbances from a variety of sources, including un-controlled encroachment due to increasing populations in coastal areas, various destructive human activities (e.g., chemical spills) in surrounding catchments, tsunamis and other storms . In some regions, due to illegal logging, mangroves have been declining at an alarming rate .\n",
            " Valiela et al. (2001) andWilkie and Fortuna (2003) observed that much of what remains from mangrove deforestation . The mangroves around the world, especially those in the developing regions, are experiencing intense spatio-temporal change . These changes are occurring in response to adjacent coral reefs or tropical forests .\n",
            " China’s mangroves naturally occur along the southeast Chinesecoastlines and in the provinces of Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guanxi, Fujian and Taiwan . Historically, half of China ’s . mangrove-centricwetlands were distributed in Guang-glydong province .\n",
            " China had a total of 23 081.5 ha mangroves in 2008, 39.4% (9084 ha) of which existed in Guangdong province . The establishment of mangrove national reserves since 1997 in the province has led to the establishment of national reserves . Mangrove-oriented studies have been conducted there .\n",
            " Few investigations conducted in Guangdong province were focused on the spatio-temporal changes in mangrove distributions . Such information would be invaluable for assessing the effec-orativetiveness of existing mangroves management approaches . The rates, rates, causes, and consequences of changes have not been adequately documented .\n",
            " Zhanjiang National Mangrove Forest Nature Reserve is the largest national-level natural reserve for mangrove protection in mainland China . The reserve was originally established in 1991, and it was approved for elevatation . The study aims to provide insights, implications, and to link the observed fragmentation trends to the local biodiversity dynamics .\n",
            " Zhanjiang mangrove national natural reserve was recently declared as a Ramsar site in January 2002 . The reserve has a notably rich biodiversity and fauna, and includes 28 species, 139 species, 130 conch species, 133 insect species and 192 bird species . In recent years mangroves have become an attractive hotspot for eco-tourism .\n",

            " The four-point historical land use data collected from the CAS were not used to assess the accuracies because of their relative coarse resolutions (1 e0.1 million), and the thematic mangrove surveys were also excluded from the validation process . The overall accuracy of the classi ﬁcation and spatial agreement were calculated respectively .\n",
            " Based on the sliding window analysis technique, the forest fragmentation model outlined in Wade et al. (2003) was developed to develop spatially explicit maps depicting six forest frag-mentation components . The missing value class was not allowed to fragment the mangroves in the current analysis .\n",
            " Mangrove fragmentation conditions were linked with changes in biodiversity of the reserve using routinely collected bird popu-centriclation survey data .

(2000)\n",
            " After 2005, birdishlysurveys were carried out mainly in spring . The number of sampling sessions was proportional to the area of mangrove, intertidal zone and aquafarm at each site .

            " A large-scale sandy area over Gaoqiao in 1977 was changed into water in 1991 . In 2000, aquaculture increased to 490 ha in Gaoquio and 2439 ha in                Yingzai, then continuously increased to 495 ha and 2526 ha in 2005 . After 1991, there was a clear trend of mangroves expanding into water at both sites .\n",

            " Satellite-based mangrove mapping affected by the local tidal rhythms . Mangrove forests are highly productive ecosystems that typi-ishly dominate the intertidal zone of tropical and subtropical coastlines . The tidal rhythms or periods over a particular place are determined by the lunar calendar (lunar gravity)\n",
            " 2001 mangrove resource thematic inventory in Guangdong province revealed 700.9 ha mangroves existed in Gaoqiao and 388.1 ha in Yingzai . However, there is a big discrepancy between the two sets of statistics .\n",
            " According to the records from the local oceanic observatory, on October 30, 2000, high tide occurred at 7:00 AM with a .tidal height of 5.15 m and low tide of 0.4 m occurred at 5:00 PM . The actual tidal height for the time when the satellite acquired data was about 3.73 m . A number of mangroves, especially the seedstands consisting of young mangrove seedlings, were undoubtedly flooded .\n",
            " The ground data from the thematic survey did not correspond with the date of satellite data classi ﬁed, and there was a time lag of about one year between when the maps were made . It is likely that some mangrove afforestation occurred over the time between when our satellite data were acquired and when the survey was conducted .\n",
            " The thematic survey was implemented from extensive ﬁeld visits . Field manual de-lineations of mangrove patches usually overestimate mangroves due to errors of human vision obstacles . It should also be noted that our satellite-based deriva-reviews resulted from interpreting 30-m resolution spectral images .\n",
            " The LandsatTM sensor was spectrally unable to discriminate these areas because of their relative low crown closure in the dominant context of water . Satellite remotely sensed data acquired at the absolute lowest tides when mangrove mapping is optimal . It is relatively rare that we have access to such data from satellite-based sources .\n",
            " Aerial photography can effectively adapt to the local tidal cycles by selectively targeting acquisitions of data at times of low tide . It is generally easier to work around clouds and atmospheric problems with aerial photographacquisitions . Different mangrove conditions have signi ﬁcant impacts on the distributions of birds such as birds .\n",
            " Interior mangrove edges and perforations have less value where the amount of forest is low ( Soledad and Santiago Santiago, 2005 ;. u (2009) argued that the intact interior mangroves were quite suitable for birds because they should afford better protections against capture than small forest patches. This is especially true because isolation can easily . easily .occur when the mangroove landscape is highly fragmented .\n",
            " The fragmentation model used in this study enabled generation of a suite of spatially explicit fragmentation maps that are effective for assessing mangrove restoration potential . These maps can help to spatially convey decision-makers ’recommendations . Conservation and oceanic management stra-glytegies should always consider the quality of the whole Mangrove landscape and especially the number of different habitats .\n",

Monitoring the dynamics of bird populations has been routine at the reserve . Changes in bird species and population numbers may be an effective mea--sure of mangrove quantity, quality and fragmentation conditions .\n",
            " Anas crecca, a mangrove-dependent local waterfoul species, went up to 200 Yuan RMB (1 US Dollar equals to 6.3 Yuan . The Cantonese desire to eat the teal has led to a sharp decline in its population in recent years . The teal population has also declined due to the over-feeding of shrimp and crabs being aqua-farmed .\n",
            " Due to diverse beach development programs, mangrove forests have shrunk gradually, leading to a sharp decline in livable habitats during the period 1977 to 1991 ( Figs. 2 and3). Thampanya.et al. (2006) also observed the same phenomenon in Thailand and Thailand .\n",
            " Chinese pond-heron, great egret and black-collared starling populations have increased by 10 e20% . The observed increase is principally attributable to the expansion of mangroves and the observed reduction of fragmentation . Bird survey for Gaoqiao (one of the mangrove study sites) suggests that conservation practice at this site has signi ﬁcantly improved the quality of mangrove habitats and attracted greater numbers of birds .\n",
            " Since 2005, the number of bird species and the total numbers of birds have gradually increased and the individual populations have expanded over time . Wu (2009) conducted a systematic survey on the mangrove forests of Zhanjiang and also found a similar trend in bird numbers as we have presented here .\n",
            " Healthymangrove forests provide adequate breeding and nursing grounds, providing adequate breeding grounds, food and shelter for birds . Analyses of mangroves change and fragmenta-like patterns of the present study are undoubtedly affected by errors in the classi-meter classi ﬁcations .\n",
            " MSS images likely resulted in a ‘lower quality ”classi ﬁcation product as compared with those from TM/ETM scenes with a 30-m resolution . Land use maps were derivedfrom the 1977 land use maps with a spatial resolution of 80 m .\n",
            " The fragmentation model used in the analysis is based on the P-f (connectivity) and the P f(forest area density) The outcomes will be highly related to the connectivity of pixels, which is closely dependent upon the accuracy of the classi ﬁcations .

            " Researchers predicted mangrove habitat changes in Guangdong, China consider-forming land-use change . They used MaxEnt and Dyna-CLUE models to simulate the impact of coastal land use . The models were coupled as an integrated framework for the study . Researchers predicted that 70% of the current trend would remain in 2030 .\n",
            " Global mangrove forests have exhibited distinct changes in the past decades owing to anthropogenic activities . Understanding the inherent con-ﬂicts between conservation/restoration and land-use demands is fundamental for management . A novel integrated framework coupling MaxEnt and Dyna-CLUE modeling was proposed . The coupled model can identify suitable mangrove afforestation habitats .\n",
            " The potential habitat of 14 man-specific species under three land-use scenarios were mapped using the combined models . Under the current trend scenario, only 41.2% of the existingwetland would be retained, whereas the potential distribution area of all the man-made species will decrease by an average of 30% .\n",
            " Mangrove ecosystems are distributed along the coasts in tropical and subtropical regions between latitudes of approximately 30° N and 30° S . Mangroves provide valuable ecosystem services by supporting coastal ﬁsheries ( Zhang et al., 2019 ) while yielding commer-giancial forest products .\n",
            " Mangroves are on the verge of extinction in 26 out of the 120 countries with mangroves ( FAO, 2007 ), owing to land use and land cover (LULC) changes from small-scale tree harvesting to clear-cutting for timber .\n",
            " A massive loss of mangrove forests, approximately 1.9 million hectares, has been reported in Asia since 1980 . Reclamation was the main cause of man-grove forest loss, with 97.6% being used to build aquacul-insuredture ponds . In China, a total of 12,924 ha have disappeared between 1980 and 2000 .\n",
            " Only 57% of replanted mangroves have been successfully restored nationwide in China . The Chinese government planned to restore 18,800 haof mangrove by 2025 . The reasons for this include urbanization and reclamation of suitable habitats and improper site selection of restoration projects .\n",
            " Mangrove habitat changes are driven by land-use pressure, the change rates, and the effect of different policies can provide an important scienti ﬁc basis for the formulation of mangrove afforestation strategies . Suitable habitats for mangroves can be mapped using species distribu-ishlytion models (SDMs) SDMs can analyze the relationship between species distribution data and en-naissancevironmental factors through statistical algorithms .\n",
            " Coupling SDMs and land-use change models can address how suitable habitats for man-geygroves interact with future land use changes . These two model types are usually used independently, i.e., either considering natural suitability(Charrua et al., 2020 ;Hu et al, 2020b ) or land pressures ( Sardar and Samadder, 2021 )\n",
            " Guangdong has the largest mangrove distribution area among China's coastal provinces . Study combined an SDM and land-use change-model focusing on Guangzhou Province . Study area is located at 20° 13 ‘N–25° 31 ‘A-N and 109° 39 ‘E’N . The Tropic of Cancer runs through the province .\n",
            " The Gross DomesticProduct (GDP) of Guangdong ranks ﬁrst nationwide with over 115 mil-                lion people ( NBSC, 2020 ), and its coastline (8500 km) covers the northerntropical and southern subtropical temperature zones . There are 14 native true mangrove species, with Avicennia marina,Aegiceras corniculatum,Sonneratia caseolaris and Andelia obovata being the most common species ( Yang et al., 2018 )\n",
            " The proposed approach consists of four steps: (1) dataset-collection and processing, including mangrove presence, environmen-naissancetal, LULC, and socioeconomic data . (2) predicting the potential suitabil-idatedity of mangroves distribution by MaxEnt modeling using the presence-data and environmental variables . (3) simulating the 2030 land-use-use change under three scenarios through Dyna-CLUE modeling; (4) predicting spatial change of habitat by deducting all the arti ﬁcial land use-use types from the theoretically suitable area .\n",
            " Reconnaissance and sam-pling surveys were conducted and combined with historical records to determine the distribution of mangrove species . Thereafter, patches were resampled into points using the Fishnetmethod in ArcGIS Pro 2.6.2, with a sampling resolution of 100 m. n checked through on-site investigations in 2018 –2019 .\n",
            " Temperature, salinity, substrate, and distance from the coastline are important factors affecting the growth and distribution of mangroves . A correlation-analysed analysis of 40 environmental variables was performed . The variables with high correlation (Pearson correlation coef ﬁcient |r| ≥0.8) were re-moved and the less correlated variables were retained .\n",
            " Suitable habitats for mangroves in Guangdong Province were pre-ordered using MaxEnt 3.4.1 ( Phillips et al., 2017 ) MaxEnt estimates the suitability of targeted species by estimating the maximum entropy of the species distribution based on input presence data . 75% of the presence data was randomly selected as training data, while 25% was used as testing data .\n",
            " The Dyna-CLUE model can simulate and predict the spatial layout of land use through quantitative analysis and summarization of the inter-actions among different land covers, and natural, policy, and social fac-naissancetors ( Verburg and Overmars, 2009 ) The model includes two parts: anon-spatial demand module for predicting future land use demand and a space allocation module .\n",
            " Land-use changes are related to various biophysical and socioeco-ethical drivers ( Peng et al. r calculating land use plans . The change rate of each LULC type was calculated using LULC data for 2015 and 2020 . In the intertidal zone, the distri-glybution dataset of the national wetland and coastal aquaculture ponds was used to complete the coastal LULC map .\n",
            " Three scenarios were developed for 2030 according to the current land-use change from 2015 to 2020 . Topographic and socio-economic indices were input into the model as driving factors . All data were resampled to 250 m ( Gong et al.  al., 2020 ).\n",
            " The ecolog-hetical protection scenario (EPS) considered aggressive ecological protection and restoration policy, completely stopping the transfer of natural to arti ﬁcial land types . 50% of the aquaculture area at 0 –6 m water depth would be restored to wetland . The spatial land-use changes of these scenarios were sim-ulated with the Dyna-CLUE model (version 2.0)\n",
            " The distribution of native mangrove species in Guangdong Province, China was assessed using the kappa value, which compared the predicted result with the actual LULC pattern in 2020 (Peng et al., 2020 ). The model accuracy was based on the predicted results of the Science of the Total Environment 788 (2021) 147914 .\n",
            " For each species group, a binary map was generated based on suitability, with a suitability threshold of 0.5 ( Wang et al.,2020b ) Grids with a value of 1 indicated that the area was a potential area for mangroves . Then, the arti ﬁcial land types (cultivated land, urban and indus-fledgedtria) were used to generate a land-use map . Pcis the expected correct simulation ratio under random conditions, calculated from the transi-tion matrix .\n",
            " Theoretical distribution of mangrove habitats was modeled using MaxEnt modeling . G1 and G6 had the widest and narrowest distribution, with an area of 160,513 and 9663 ha, respectively . Species richness decreased with increasing latitude .\n",
            " We screened and listed the top three important variables for each group in Table 4 . The annual precip-inducingitation, SST in the coldest season, and salinity range showed important contributions in most groups . These environmental variables were used to describe the multidimensional niche of each group .\n",

            " The AUC values for the Dyna-CLUE predictions were 0.54 –0.84, 88% of which exceeded 0.70 ( Table 5 ), indicating that the selected driving fac-ishlytors had strong explanatory power for the conversion of land .\n",
            " The coastal zone of Guangdong is a typical area with rapid socioeco-ethical development and urbanization . Under CTS, aquaculture and urban/industrial land were the main net in ﬂow land types . However, under the alternative policies, land-use transfer patterns showed great changes .\n",
            " Under SDS, the woodland and water areas were maintained at the level they were in 2020 . Under EPS, the wetland area was restored to over three times that in 2015 ( Fig. 6 ) The area of wetland increased signif-ishlyicantly .\n",
            " The suitable areas estimated using MaxEnt described the environ-uvemental limits for the presence of mangrove species . Next, the current and future anthropogenic factors (urbanization, restoration, etc.) were imposed onto the theoretically suitable areas to predict the actual affor-uveestation extent of forests . All arti ﬁcial land types (cultivated land, urban and industrial land, and aquaculture) were deemed suitable .\n",
            " If the current land-use policy is maintained until 2030, the potential distribution area of all mangrove species will decrease by an average of approximately 30% . However, under the other two scenarios, different mangroves showed varied sensi-centricity to conservation and restoration policies . The mangroove distribu-tion area could be increased by 11% –61% depending on the different species groups .\n",
            " Our study estimated the potential suitable habitat of 14 mangrove species in Guangdong Province . According to the Red List of Threat--ishlyened Species of China, A. speciosum and A. ebracteatus in G6 are classi ﬁed as endangered .\n",
            " A. speciosum, B. sexangula, and S. caseolaris lost in their original distribution sites in the 1990s . Aquaculture development was the most important reason for the loss of these species . The mangrove species richness in Guangdong Province decreases with increasing latitude ( Quisthoudt et al., 2012 ;Wu et al. on. 2018 .\n",
            " In Shantou, after years of afforestation practice, most of the existing mangrove species belong to G1- to G7 species . Latitude limitation suggests that owing to tolerance to low temperatures, the success rate of res-ishly-toration may be reduced by transplanting species northward .\n",
            " Land-use pattern in 2015, 2020, and 2030 under three scenarios . CTS, SDS, sustainable development scenario; EPS, ecologica l protection scenario. CTS is current trend scenario; SDS is sustainable development. EPS is the protection scenario of 2030 (ha)\n",
            " Land-use change was the crucial driver of mangrove habitat shrinkage . Under CTS, the continuous expansion of aquaculture, as well as urban and industrial land, led to a signi ﬁcant decrease in man-reviewed habitat .\n",
            " Unmanualized urban expansion is the most important threat for mangroves in developing countries and regions . Urbanization has destroyed more than 30% of the Brazilian. southeastern mangrove. grove forests (ha) The aquaculture area in Hainan Province in-creased in 1966 –2009 .\n",
            " In Honduras, 19.1% of mangroves have been converted to urban areas since 1985 . In Guangdong Province, there was a correlation between the increase in urban regions and the loss of forests . Land-use change not only directly affects the coastal estuarine area, but also disturbs total direct runoff regimes and shifts upstream catchment areas .\n",
            " In Guangdong Province, most mangroves have been isolated by aquaculture and buildings from terrestrial habitats . There-                fore, nature reserves had no choice but to extend their boundaries to low intertidal zones . This reduced the actual protection rate of suitable mangrove hab-                itats after 2000 .\n",
            " The success rate of coastal ﬁshpond farming in southern China is only about 35%, and 30% of aquaculture ponds are currently abandoned . It would be possible to return some of the ponds that cause the most serious disturbance to man-groves, to minimize the impact on the livelihood of local communities .\n",
            " Previous studies on mangrove distribution used a single SDM to ex-plain the in-                plain the impact of natural environmental factors on current man-glyve distribution . However, land use often plays a direct role in the change in the distribution of mangroves . Land-use policies are needed to maintain and recover this group in addition to land-use policy changes .\n",
            " This study proved that MaxEnt and Dyna-CLUE models can be successfully coupled to the simulation of man-grove distribution change in the future . In the current scenario, the maximum potential habitat was estimated to be 34,531 ha, which is close to the 32,326 ha obtained through the for-repreestry surveys .\n",
            " Land-use patterns were adopted as crucial drivers to predict future changes of mangrove habitats . However, the actual habitat extent was over-estimated because the Maxent model could not identify environ-gianmental heterogeneity within 1 km . The use of the deductive method with higher-resolution land use data could constrain the habitat extent .\n",
            " Long-term survivorship and stable mangrove stands may require more than 10 years . Mangrove forest distribution is not only related to environmental conditions but is also affected by land development, such as land development . Mangrove degradation drivers such as pollution, excavation, and cultivation within the forest were not fully considered .\n",

            " Mangrove forests are tropical trees and shrubs that grow in sheltered intertidal zones . Mapping of mangrove forests is a great challenge for remote sensing because mangroves are submerged by tidal waters . Multi-tide images are often unavailable due to rainy climates and uncertain tidal conditions .\n",
            " The practical roles of MFI were validated by applying it to three mangrove forest sites globally . Practically, after applying the MFI to three global sites, 99–102% of submerged mangroves were successfully extracted by MFI . Although there are still some uncertainties and limitations, the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrumen has great beneﬁts .\n",
            " Remote sensing has been widely used to monitor the distribution of mangrove forests for decades . Remote sensing is essential for monitoring the current and past acreage and condition of these ecosystems . There is an emerging demand for conservation and restoration in mangroves .\n",
            " Mangrove forests located near the shoreline are periodicallysubmerged by tides, especially in regions with high tide and lower mangrove shrubs [ 9,10].Ideally, it is better to use images acquired during low tides; however, such data are difficult to obtain due to uncertainties of local instantaneous tidal conditions .\n",
            " Remote sensing of submerged and emerged aquatic vegetation has been widely studied . Hyperspectral images with numerous narrow and contiguous bands is reliable for studying aquatic vegetation . Yet, Landsat only has one band in the spectral region of near infrared (760–900 nm), which may become less sensitive as water depth increases .\n",
            " Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) sensor has 10–20 m spatial resolution and near infrared bands in near infrared region . Machine-learning algorithms such as random forest, neural network, and support vector machine provide promising accuracy in mangrove forests [ 10,13,29].\n",
            " Normalized Di ulent Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the most commonly used index in global vegetation studies . Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and the ModiﬁedNormalized Di .ulent Water Index were proposed and widely used for mapping surface water . These indices are insensitive to small variations of the re-ectance of submerged mangrove forests and water .\n",
            " The Mangrove Forest-Index (MFI) is capable to map the distribution of mangroves based on a single date MSI image . Meanwhile, bands used to build MCI and FVI did not exist in the Sentinel-2 image . MFI will be applied to three sitesRemote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 .\n",
            " Sentinel-2 MSI images were downloaded from European Space Agency Sentinels meticulouslyScientiﬁc Data Hub . The images were preprocessed with geometric and radiometric corrections at roughly sub-pixel accuracy . After atmospheric correction, all remaining bands wer excluded bands with a spatial resolution of 60 m .\n",
            " The study area, Zhenzhu Harbor, China, is located in Guangxi Province, GuangxiProvince, in the southwest portion of mainland China and the north region of Tonkin Gulf (Figure 1) Study Area is mainly composed of mangrove forests .\n",
            " The Zhenzhu Harbor is a typical area for the study of submerged mangrove forests . The area is diurnal, with an average tidal range of 2.24 m, and the mangroves here are primarily younger shrubs . During local high tide some of the forests were submerged during high tides .\n",
            " Ground surveys were conducted along the coasts of Zhenzhu Harbor in November 2017 . The locations of each sampling point was measured using a global positioning system (GPS), with an error less than 1 m. l of the nearest tide station (Fangcheng Harbor Station, 108.140E, 21.280N) A reference-oriented map was built based on object-oriented methods and visual interpretation .\n",
            " Visual interpretation was performed to classify objects as either mangrove forests or water . A false color composite of MSI Bands 11 (centered 1610 nm), Band 8 (centered 842 nm), and Band 4 (centered 665 nm) was generated . The image analysis program was used to conduct object-oriented classiﬁcation .\n",
            " Using the same techniques as above, mangrove forests were identiﬁed from the high-tide MSI image . Figure 3 shows the distributions of emerged and submerged mangroves . Figure 4 shows the measurements of spectral curves of the water, emerged vegetation and submerged vegetation, generated by Chen et al. (2018; Figure 4A) and Visser et. (2015)\n",
            " Waterbody is characterized by low reﬂectance in near infrared at about700 nm . emerged mangrove has relatively high re�aactance, which make them separable from each other . When submerged vegetation is 43–51 cm below clear water, NDVI value was close to zero .\n",
            " Figure 5 shows the typical spectral curves of water (WB), emerged mangrove forest (EMF), and submerged mangroves (SMF) that are observed on the MSI image . Traditional multispectral satellite sensors could not capture these reﬂectance peaks . Fortunately, the MSI sensor has channels that cover these regions .\n",

The higher reﬂectance in bands 5 (centered 705 nm), 6 (centered . 783 nm), 7.8 (centered 842 nm), and 8A (centered. 865 nm) could be . used to . distinguish submerged vegetation’s .rere﬉ectance at 1.5, 16, and 40 cm below water surface .\n",
            " There are no obvious reﬂectance di erences in bands green, red, and SWIR between submerged vegetation and water bodies [33,34,45]. These indices are not suitable for discerning submerged vegetation from water bodies . The absorption valleys in band 4 (centered.665 nm) and band 12 could be used to form a baseline (Figure 6)\n",
            " Band 8 was excluded because Bands 7 (centered 783 nm) and 8A (centered 865 nm) covered most of its spectra . Band 8A above the baseline, is deﬁned as MFI . Pixels with an MFI value above 0 are recognized as mangrove forests .\n",

            " To compare the ability to distinguish submerged mangrove forests from the water background, the VIs values were calculated . The MFI and Floating Algae Index (FAI) were calculated to 10 times their original values . The boxplots are shown in Figure 7.2, with SMF SMF on the surface, WB on the background . SMF means submerged man grove forest, WB means Water Body .\n",
            " Most of the water pixels are confused with submerged mangrove forests in FAI, NDVI, and NDWI images . MFI values are better separated in an MFI image than other VIs . Three selected sites were chosen to demonstrate the practical utility of our newly formed index (MFI)\n",
            " Locations of mangrove forests are shown in Figure 8 . Table 3 shows the overall accuracy, user’s accuracy, producer’re accuracy, and Kappa coe cient of each site . In Zhenzhu Harbor, the validation samples were collected from survey. In Dalhousie Island and Baja do Arraial, validation samples. were randomly selected from Google Earth high-resolution images.\n",

            " The overall accuracy of this mangrove map is 97% with a Kappa coe cient of 0.94 . In Zhenzhu Harbor, Guangxi, China, the MFI values range from 0.19 to 0.30,                 0.18, and 0.01.01 . Dalhousie Island, Sundarbans, India has the biggest patch of mangroves on the world’s largest delta with seasonal variation between 1 and 6 m .\n",

            " The overall accuracy of this mangrove map is 96.8%, with a Kappa coe cient of 0.93.8% . In Dalhousie Island, the MFIvalue of emerged mangroves, submerged mgrove forests, and. water pixels range from 0.11 to 0.25, 0.10 to –0.03, and 0.03 to 0 .25, respectively . Baia do Arraial is located along the south coasts of S ão Lu ís city, Brazil .\n",
            " The overall accuracy of this MFI map is 91.7%, with a Kappa coe cient of 0.83. d; fortunately, these mangrove forests showed positive values in Figure 11B, and the snapshot of Google Earth images conﬁrmed that these places were occupied by low mangroves . In Baia do Arraial, the MFI values of emerged.mangrove forests, submerged mangroove forests, . water pixels, and water pixels range from 0.09 to 0.25, and 0.06 to .09 .\n",
            " The lack of full consideration of tidal conditions would cause misclassiﬁcation between mangrove forests and water background . In LSWI, MNDWI, NDVI, and FAI images 27%, 8%, 19%, and 5% of submerged pixels were mixed with water background during high tides .\n",
            " The FAI was established based on baseline theory, but with one NIR band . However, unlike MFI (completely separated submerged mangrove forest and water), in the FPI image, 5% of submerged Mangrove forests pixels were mixed with water .\n",
            " Theoretically, the MFI concept can be applied to other sensors that contain spectral channels of red, NIR, and SWIR, for example, the Landsat OLI sensor which has a red band ranging from 630 to 690 nm . However, the adaptability of the concept to other remote sensing sensors still requires further examination .\n",
            " The MFI function can identify and detect mangrove forests from water background . However, the MFI was designed based on the reﬂectance peak between red and SWIR . Any other vegetation that contains absorption signatures of chlorophyll in aquatic environment can also be detected .\n",
            " Due to limits in image resolution, a small area of the water could still be classiﬁed as mangrove forests . These uncertainties can lead to overestimation of the MFI . In our application in Dalhousie Island, Sundarbans, India, the bias of MFI is 2% larger .\n",
            " Chen et al. discovered that when submerged vegetation coverage was less than 40%, it is di icated to detect vegetation based on the NIR peak in the spectral reﬂectance curve . Water in mangrove swamps always has high turbidity (0.5 nephelometric turbidity units), typical vegetationreﬁectance was undetectable at a water depth of 1 m.\n",
            " A new vegetation index (MFI) was developed to distinguish mangrove forests from the water background . The MFI is more advantageous in detecting submerged mangroves than the traditional NDVI, LSWI, MNDWI, and FAI indices .\n",
            " Theoretically, 100% of submerged mangrove forests could be extracted from MFI images . Practically, application of the MFI in three global mangroves showed 99% to 102% were successfully extracted . The overall accuracy of classiﬁcation results obtained from the .

            " Research shows that mangrove conservation may be a low-cost means of reducing CO 2emissions . Using climatological and locational data as predictors, we explore several predictive models . Using over 900 soil carbon measurements, collected in 28countries by 61 independent studies, we develop a global predictive model .\n",
            " With our predictive model, weconstruct a global dataset of estimated soil carbon concentrations and stocks on a high-resolutiongrid (5 arc min) We estimate that the global mangrove soil carbon stock is 5.00 ± 0.94 Pg C(assuming a 1 meter soil depth) and ﬁnd this stock is highly variable over space . The amount of carbon per hectare in the world ’s most carbon-rich mangroves (approximately 703 ± 38 Mg C ha                −1) is roughly a 2.6 .6 .\n",
            " Results can be used to project changes in mangrove soil carbon stocks based on changing climatologicalpredictors, e.g. to assess the impacts of climate change on mangroves . The results can also be used as a tool to assess changes in soil carbon .\n",
            " Mangroves contain three to four times the mass of carbon typically found in boreal, temperate, or upland tropical forests . Recent studies point to mangrove conservation as a potentially low-cost option for reducing CO2 emissions .\n",
            " In most mangrove areas of the world, protecting mangroves achieves emissions reductions at a lower cost than reducing emissions elsewhere in the econ-omy. Accordingly, there is growing interest in developing andimplementing market-based mechanisms such as carbon off-sets .\n",
            " A key challenge in assessing the carbon bene ﬁts from mangrove conservation is the lack of rigorous spatial estimates . Unlike other tropical forests, the bulk of carbon storage is in biomass . soil carbon comprises 49 –98% of carbon stored in the soil .\n",
            " We use data to estimate global mangrovesoil carbon concentrations (mg C cm                −3) and stocks (Pg C) on a high-resolution grid (5 arc min) Our predictive model is based on soil carbon measurements compiled in the meta-analyses by Chmura et al (2003 ) Kristensen et al . and Donato et al. combined include data from over 900 samples collected in 28 countries, which contain 64.4% of global mangouves .\n",

Kristensen and Donato et al study the spatial distribution of above-ground biomass . Our predictive model can be helpful in assessing the impacts of climate change onmangrove carbon storage .\n",
            " A total of 932 samples were collected in 28 countries by 61 independent studies . We convert soil carbon measurements into bulk den-sity measurements following Donato et al (2011) and Kristensen et al . We then use the soil bulk density to calculate the carbon content in g C per cubic centimeter .\n",
            " For the majority of the soil carbon data, source studies report precise locational data,i.e. latitude coordinates reported to the 0.1 of a degree, and severalvariables describing climate conditions at the sampling loca-tions, and regional indicators . The data are available in the online supplementary materials at stacksiop.org/ERL/9/104013/mmedia .\n",
            " The latitude data are used to calculate distance from the equator, which has been linked to mangrove productivity, and therefore may be an important predictor of soil carbon . Climate variables are from the WorldClim Bioclim data (Hijmans et al 2005)\n",
            " We include regional indicators, where regions are ranked according to the ten biogeographic regions for man-groves developed by Spalding et al (2010) Our model controls for the impacts of unobserved factors on carbon concentration in mangrove soils .\n",
            " Constructing a robust predictive model requires balancing the most variation in the data sample with the model ’s generalizability, i.e. Its ability to predict out of the sample (Babyak 2004 ) We evaluate the alternatives models to predict soil carbon concentrations .\n",
            " The model is estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS) We compare the parametric predictive models based on in-sample predictive power and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) We estimate several speci ﬁcations of equation (2), where certain parameters or sets of parameters are constrained to equal zero .\n",
            " ML algorithms offer an alternative to single-equation parametric predictive modeling . They involve computational learning in the model-building process .

Traditionally, multi-tides images were needed to remove the\\ninﬂuence of water; however, such images are often unavailable due to rainy climates and uncertain\\nlocal tidal conditions. Therefore, extracting mangrove forests from a single-tide imagery is of great\\nimportance. In this study, reﬂectance of red-edge bands in Sentinel-2 imagery were utilized to\\nestablish a new vegetation index that is sensitive to submerged mangrove forests. Speciﬁcally, red\\nand short-wave near infrared bands were used to build a linear baseline; the average reﬂectance\\nvalue of four red-edge bands above the baseline is deﬁned as the Mangrove Forest Index (MFI).\\nTo evaluate MFI, capabilities of detecting mangrove forests were quantitatively assessed between\\nMFI and four widely used vegetation indices (VIs). Additionally, the practical roles of MFI were\\nvalidated by applying it to three mangrove forest sites globally. Results showed that: (1) theoretically,\\nJensen–Shannon divergence demonstrated that a submerged mangrove forest and water pixels have\\nthe largest distance in MFI compared to other VIs. In addition, the boxplot showed that all submerged\\nmangrove forests could be separated from the water background in the MFI image. Furthermore, in\\nthe MFI image, to separate mangrove forests and water, the threshold is a constant that is equal to\\nzero. (2) Practically, after applying the MFI to three global sites, 99–102% of submerged mangrove\\nforests were successfully extracted by MFI. Although there are still some uncertainties and limitations,\\nthe MFI o \\x0bers great beneﬁts in accurately mapping mangrove forests as well as other coastal and\\naquatic vegetation worldwide.\\nKeywords: Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI); red-edge band; aquatic vegetation; tidal\\ncondition; vegetation index; coastal vegetation\\n1. Introduction\\nMangrove forest are highly productive ecosystems with signiﬁcant ecological and socio- economic\\nimportance in the world [ 1,2]. However, over the past century, these forests have declined at an\\nalarming rate that is more rapid than that of inland tropical forests [ 3]. Therefore, there is an emerging\\ndemand for conservation and restoration e \\x0borts in mangrove forests. Obtaining accurate information\\nRemote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043; doi:10.3390 /rs11172043 www.mdpi.com /journal /remotesensingRemote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 2 of 17\\nregarding the current and past acreage and condition of mangrove forests is essential for e \\x0ecient\\nmanagement of these ecosystems and for policy- and decision-making processes [4,5].\\nLocated in intertidal zones, mangrove forests are often inaccessible for traditional ﬁeld surveys.\\nFor decades, remote sensing has been widely used to monitor the distribution of mangrove forests, yet\\naccurate and timely interpretation of the relatively small patches has been rare, due to the lack of full\\nconsideration of tidal conditions [ 6–9]. Mangrove forests located near the shoreline are periodically\\nsubmerged by tides, especially in regions with high tide ﬂuctuations and lower mangrove shrubs [ 9,10].\\nIdeally, it is better to use images acquired during low tides; however, such data are di \\x0ecult to obtain,\\ndue to uncertainties of local instantaneous tidal conditions during predetermined times that satellites\\npass over [ 11,12]. For a long time, numerous studies have pointed out that tides may seriously\\ninﬂuence remote sensing results of mangrove forests, yet, solutions were not reported until the past\\ntwo years [ 10,13,14]. However, all these studies used multi-tides (multi-date) images; therefore, we\\nhave one concern: if multi-tides images are not available due to rainy climates and uncertain local tide\\nconditions, how could we accurately map mangrove forests by a single-date image?\\nOver the last two decades, remote sensing of submerged and emerged aquatic vegetation has\\nbeen widely studied [ 15,16]. Hyperspectral image with numerous narrow and contiguous bands is\\nreliable for studying aquatic vegetation and is able to detect the biophysical properties of vegetation\\ne\\x0eciently [ 16–19]. However, there is no freely available satellite hyperspectral data in recent years, and\\nairborne applications are exorbitantly expensive and only cover a very small spatial extent. Landsat\\nimages with moderate spatial resolution of 30–60 m have been widely used for mapping aquatic\\nvegetation [ 20–24]. Yet, Landsat only has one band in the spectral region of near infrared (760–900 nm),\\nwhich may become less sensitive as water depth increases [ 25]. The MODIS (Moderate Resolution\\nImaging Spectroradiometer) and AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) are publicly\\navailable with high spectral resolution but coarse spatial resolution (250–1100 m, respectively), making\\nthem unsuitable for mangrove detection [ 9]. In contrast, the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument\\n(MSI) sensor has a 10–20 m spatial resolution and ﬁve bands in near infrared region, which provides\\nopportunities to conduct quick, robust, and e \\x0ecient monitoring of submerged mangrove forests.\\nFor years, numerous methods were utilized to map mangrove forests as well as other aquatic\\nvegetation from remote sensing imagery, ranging from pixel to object-oriented approach, and manual\\nto unsupervised methods [ 9,14,26–28]. Recently, machine-learning algorithms such as random\\nforest, neural network, and support vector machine provide promising accuracy in mangrove forests\\nextraction [ 10,13,29]. As it is hard to locate representative training samples due to uncertain tidal\\nconditions, it is relatively hard to apply these methods to extract submerged mangrove forests from\\na single-date image. Vegetation indices (VIs), which are mathematically determined based on the\\nspectral characteristics of vegetation, have been proven e \\x0ecient in monitoring vegetation from\\nspace [ 30]. The Normalized Di \\x0berence Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the most commonly used index\\nin global vegetation studies (e.g., [ 30,31]). The Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and the Modiﬁed\\nNormalized Di \\x0berence Water Index (MNDWI) were proposed and widely used for mapping surface\\nwater [ 32–34]. Given that these indices are established based on di \\x0berences between two bands,\\nthey are insensitive to small variations of the reﬂectance of submerged mangrove forests and water\\nbackground [ 14]. Furthermore, it is hard to decide thresholds that distinguish submerged mangroves\\nand water. With more bands, several VIs were built based on a baseline theory, such as Maximum\\nChlorophyll Index (MCI; [ 35]), the Floating Algae Index (FAI; [ 36]), and the Floating Vegetation Index\\n(FVI; [ 17]). However, these indices were deﬁned to extract ﬂoating vegetation (above water surface)\\nfrom water, not submerged vegetation. Meanwhile, bands used to build MCI and FVI did not exist in\\nSentinel MSI image.\\nThus, the objective of this study is to develop a new vegetation index, called the Mangrove Forest\\nIndex (MFI), which is capable to map the distribution of mangroves based on a single date MSI image.\\nThen, we will compare MFI with other widely used VIs to validate MFI’s capabilities in detecting\\nsubmerged mangrove forests from water background. Additionally, MFI will be applied to three sitesRemote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 3 of 17\\nof typical mangrove forests worldwide; the practical roles of mapping mangrove forests during local\\nhigh-tide conditions will also be discussed.\\n2. Materials and Methods\\n2.1. Sentinel-2 Imagery\\nSentinel-2, a European Space Agency (ESA) land-monitoring mission, has two matching satellites\\nthat provide high-resolution optical imagery. Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B carry the MultiSpectral\\nInstrument (MSI) and were successfully launched in June 2015 and March 2017 respectively and\\nprovide important means to augment earth observation capabilities [ 37]. These satellites revisit the\\nsame location every 2 to 5 days. The MSI sensor o \\x0bers 13 spectral bands, with four bands at 10 m, six\\nbands at 20 m, and three bands at a 60 m spatial resolution (Table 1) and o \\x0bers a wide range of earth\\nobservation applications [38].\\nIn this study, Sentinel-2 MSI images were downloaded from European Space Agency Sentinels\\nScientiﬁc Data Hub; the images were preprocessed with geometric and radiometric corrections at\\nsub-pixel accuracy. Then, atmospheric correction (converting top-of-atmosphere reﬂectance into\\ntop-of-canopy reﬂectance) was performed by the tool of SEN2COR (version 2.05.05), which was\\navailable in the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) toolbox [ 39,40]. In order to standardize di \\x0berent\\nspatial resolutions of bands in MSI images, we excluded bands with a spatial resolution of 60 m (Band\\n1, Band 9, and Band 10). After atmospheric correction, all remaining bands were resampled to a pixel\\nsize of 20 m\\x0220 m.\\nTable 1.

Study Area\\nThe study area, Zhenzhu Harbor (21\\x0e280–21\\x0e420N and 108\\x0e000–108\\x0e200N), is located in Guangxi\\nProvince, China, in the southwest portion of mainland China and the north region of Tonkin Gulf\\n(Figure 1). In Zhenzhu Harbor, mangrove forests are mainly composed of four communities: Comm. A.\\nmarina, Comm. A. corniculatum, Comm. A. marina–A. corniculatum, and Comm. K. candel–A. corniculatum .\\nThe tides in the coast of Zhenzhu Harbor are diurnal, with an average tidal range of 2.24 m, and\\nmangrove forests here are primarily younger shrubs with an average height of less than 3 m [ 7].\\nTherefore, the Zhenzhu Harbor is a typical area for the study of submerged mangrove forests, due to a\\nlarge area of pioneer mangrove trees and shrubs that would be entirely submerged during high tides\\n(Figure 1A,B). Information of MSI images we selected are shown in Table 2.Remote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 4 of 17\\nAdditionally, a ﬁeld survey of Zhenzhu Harbor was conducted during April 2017, in which 408\\nground truth samples were collected including samples of mangrove forest, open water, and other\\nland cover.\\nFigure 1.

Build a Reference Map\\nGround surveys were conducted along the coasts of Zhenzhu Harbor in November 2017. The\\nlocation of each sampling point was measured using a global positioning system (GPS), with an error\\nless than 1 m. The observations collected in the surveys contained 85 mangrove points and 81 water\\npoints. A vector ﬁle of ground survey points with the attributes of location (longitude and latitude),\\nland cover types, and photos was created with ArcGIS.\\nThe spectral curves of water, submerged mangrove forests, and emerged mangrove forests were\\nextracted from images. The workﬂow of discriminating these classes is shown in Figure 2. A reference\\nmap was built based on object-oriented methods and visual interpretation.\\nThe description of the object-oriented method can be found in Harayama and Jaquet [ 41]. The\\neCognition Developer 9.0, an image analysis program, was used to conduct object-oriented classiﬁcation.\\nVisual interpretation was performed to classify objects as either mangrove forests or water. To facilitateRemote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 5 of 17\\nvisual interpretation, a false color composite of MSI Bands 11 (centered 1610 nm), Band 8 (centered\\n842 nm), and Band 4 (centered 665 nm) was generated. This band combination that was deemed the\\nbest for detecting mangroves which appears dark green color [ 42]. Furthermore, in order to conduct the\\nadjustment in a robust manner, visual interpretation was performed by an experienced remote sensing\\nexpert who was familiar with this area. First, we identiﬁed mangrove forest and surrounding water\\nfrom the low-tide MSI image. Subsequently, a confusion matrix was generated using the independent\\nground-truth samples described in Section 2.2. With this matrix, we achieved an overall classiﬁcation\\naccuracy of 97% with a Kappa coe \\x0ecient of 0.92, which indicated excellent agreements between our\\nmapping results and ground-truth data. Therefore, mangrove forests identiﬁed with this method\\nwere assumed to cover entire area of local mangrove forests. Second, using the same techniques as\\nabove, mangrove forests were identiﬁed from the high-tide MSI image. Finally, the extent of the\\nsubmerged mangrove was determined by subtracting the high-tide from the low-tide mangrove forest\\nmap. Figure 3 shows the distributions of emerged mangrove forests and submerged mangrove forests\\nin the high-tidal MSI image.\\nFigure 2. Work ﬂow for identifying submerge mangrove forests.Remote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 6 of 17\\nFigure 3. Distribution of emerged and submerged mangrove forests in high-tide MSI image.\\n2.4. Theories\\nFigure 4 shows the ﬁeld measurements of spectral curves of the water, emerged vegetation,\\nand submerged vegetation, generated by Chen et al. (2018; Figure 4A) and Visser et al. (2015;\\nFigure 4B) [ 15,25]. As normal green plants, vegetation above the water surface showed high reﬂectance\\nin the spectral region of 770–890 nm. Waterbody is characterized by low reﬂectance in near infrared at\\n700 nm while emerged mangrove has a relatively high reﬂectance, which make them separable from\\neach other. However, when mangroves are submerged under water, the reﬂectance is largely reduced,\\ntherefore, it is di \\x0ecult to distinguish submerged vegetation from waterbody [ 15,25,43]. As measured,\\nwhen submerged vegetation are 43–51 cm below clear water, the NDVI value was close to zero, which\\nmeans no di \\x0berences were observed between the red band and NIR band [44].\\nHowever, by careful inspection of the spectral curves shown in Figure 4A,B, two reﬂectance\\npeaks ranging from approximately 690–740 nm and 810–830 nm were found, even for the curves of\\nvegetation located 40 cm below the water surface. These peaks result from the competing e \\x0bects\\nof the chlorophyll reﬂectance plateau and the absorption e \\x0bects of water located within submerged\\nvegetation and the surrounding water background. However, traditional multispectral satellite sensors\\ncould not capture these reﬂectance peaks. Fortunately, the MSI sensor has ﬁve channels that cover\\nthese regions. Figure 5 shows the typical spectral curves of water (WB), emerged mangrove forest\\n(EMF), and submerged mangrove forest (SMF) that are observed on the MSI image. As shown in\\nFigure 5, the emerged and shallow submerged mangrove forest pixels demonstrated a strong reﬂection\\nin the region of 660–900 nm, the absorption valleys appeared in bands 4 (centered wavelength 665 nm)\\nand 12 (centered 2160 nm). For the submerged mangrove forest (b) curves, a small reﬂectance peak\\nappeared in the 660–900 nm region; the absorption valley also appeared in bands 4 (centered 665 nm)\\nand 12 (centered 2160 nm). The reﬂectance of the water pixels shows a continuous decreasing tendency\\nbeginning with band 4 (central wavelength 665 nm). Therefore, comparing submerged curves to water\\ncurves, the higher reﬂectance in bands 5 (centered 705 nm), 6 (centered 740 nm), 7 (centered 783 nm),\\n8 (centered 842 nm), and 8A (centered 865 nm) could be used to distinguish submerged mangrove\\nforests from the water background.Remote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 7 of 17\\nFigure 4.

Existing Vegetation Indices\\nPreviously, NDVI (Equation 1), LSWI (Equation 2), and MNDWI (Equation 3) and FAI (Equation\\n4) were used in detecting vegetation from water bodies [33,34,45].\\nNDVI =\\x1aNIR\\x00\\x1aRed\\n\\x1aNIR+\\x1aRed(1)\\nLSWI =\\x1aNIR\\x00\\x1aSWIR\\n\\x1aNIR+\\x1aSWIR(2)\\nMNDWI =\\x1aGreen\\x00\\x1aSWIR\\n\\x1aGreen +\\x1aSWIR(3)\\nFAI=\\x08\\x1a860\\x00[\\x1a1240+(\\x1a660\\x00\\x1a1240)\\x02(1240\\x00860)/(1240\\x00660)]\\t(4)\\nwhere\\x1aGreen ,\\x1aRed,\\x1aNIR, and\\x1aSWIR are the reﬂectance of the green, red, NIR, and SWIR, respectively.\\nHowever, these indices are not suitable for discerning submerged vegetation from water bodies,\\nbecause there are no obvious reﬂectance di \\x0berences in bands green, red, and SWIR between submerged\\nvegetation and water bodies (Figures 4 and 5).Remote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 8 of 17\\n2.6. Formulation of MFI\\nFor this study, according to the analysis in Section 2.4, the absorption valleys in band 4 (centered\\n665 nm) and band 12 (centered 2190 nm) could be used to form a baseline (Figure 6). In order to\\nenhance the stability of di \\x0berences between submerged mangrove forests and the water background,\\nthe average value of reﬂectance of band 5 (centered 705 nm), band 6 (centered 740 nm), band 7 (centered\\n783 nm), and band 8A (centered 865 nm) above the baseline, is deﬁned as MFI. Band 8 was excluded\\nbecause Bands 7 (centered 783 nm) and 8A (centered 865 nm) covered most of its spectra, and its\\nspectral range overlaps with the water absorption region. The mathematical formulation is\\nMFI =h\\n(\\x1a\\x151\\x00\\x1aB\\x151)+(\\x1a\\x152\\x00\\x1aB\\x152)+(\\x1a\\x153\\x00\\x1aB\\x153)+(\\x1a\\x154\\x00\\x1aB\\x154\\x11\\n]/4 (5)\\n\\x1aB\\x15i=\\x1a2190+(\\x1a665\\x00\\x1a2190)\\x02(2190\\x00\\x15i)/(2190\\x00665) (6)\\nwhere the \\x1a\\x15is the reﬂectance of the band center of \\x15, and iranged from 1 to 4; \\x151,\\x152,\\x153,\\x154represent\\nthe center wavelengths at 705, 740, 783 and 865 nm, respectively. \\x1aB\\x15iis the baseline reﬂectance in\\n\\x15i.\\x1a665and\\x1a2190are the reﬂectance of band 4 (centered at 665 nm) and 12 (centered at 2190 nm),\\nrespectively. Pixels with an MFI value above 0 are recognized as mangrove forests.\\nFigure 6. Baseline theory of establishing Mangrove Forest Index (MFI), including reﬂectance of\\nsubmerged mangrove forest and water.\\n2.7. Quantitative Comparison between MFI and Other VIs\\nIn this study, Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD)—a measure of distance between a ﬁnite number\\nof distributions—was adopted to compare sensitivities of MFI and other VIs. The JSD ( D) quantiﬁes\\nthe di \\x0berence between two or more probability distributions. In this study, it was used to compare\\nthe di \\x0berences between submerged mangrove forests and water pixels in di \\x0berent VI images. The\\nDvalue, which was calculated in MATLAB, is deﬁned as follows: let p(1)\\x11(p(1)\\n1,p(1)\\n2,:::,p(1)\\nk)\\nand p(2)\\x11\\x12\\np(2)\\n1,p(2)\\n2,:::,p(2)\\nk\\x13\\ndenote two probability distributions satisfying the usual constraints\\nPk\\ni=1p(j)\\ni=1and 0\\x14p(j)\\ni\\x141for all i=1,2,:::,k and j=1,2; and let \\x19(1)and\\x19(2)denote the weights\\nof the distributions p(1)and p(2), satisfying the constraints \\x19(1)+\\x19(2)=1and 0\\x14\\x19(j)\\x141.

The boxplots of submerged mangrove forests and water pixels are shown in Figure 7.\\nFigure 7.

Zhenzhu Harbor, Guangxi, China\\nMFI was applied to the high-tidal Sentinel MSI image (acquired 2017-09-28). Figure 9 shows\\nthe MFI image (Figure 9A), mangrove forest distribution classiﬁed from MFI image (Figure 9B), and\\nreference map (Figure 9C) derived from low-tide Sentinel MSI images (described in Section 2.3).\\nAccording to the results shown in the reference map (Figure 9C), the total area of mangrove forests was\\n856.30 ha, with 107.05 ha of submerged and 749.25 ha of emerged mangrove forests. In Figure 9B, the\\ntotal area of mangrove forest we classiﬁed from the MFI image was 849.4 ha, which means 99% of the\\nmangrove forest pixels were successfully extracted from water background by the MFI. According to\\nTable 3, the overall accuracy of this mangrove map is 97% with a Kappa coe \\x0ecient of 0.94. In Zhenzhu\\nHarbor, the MFI value of emerged mangrove forests, submerged mangrove forests, and water pixels\\nrange from 0.19 to 0.30, \\x000.01 to 0.18, and\\x000.2 to\\x000.01.\\nFigure 9.

Dalhousie Island, Sundarbans, India\\nSundarbans has the biggest patch of mangrove forest ﬂourishing on the world’s largest delta\\n(Ganga–Bramhaputra–Meghna Delta; [ 47]). The tidal amplitude within the estuary ranges from 3.5\\nto 4 m, with seasonal variation between 1 and 6 m; mangrove forests are periodically submerged\\nduring high tide [ 48,49]. In this study, Dalhousie Island (located in the southern part of Sundarbans,\\nIndia) was chosen as a typical area to validate the performance of the MFI. Figure 10 shows a local\\nhigh-tidal MSI image (Figure 10A, captured on 2016-10-17), the MFI-derived image (Figure 10B), andRemote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 12 of 17\\nground-truth images obtained by Google Earth snapshot (Figure 10a–c). As shown in Figure 10A, in\\nmangrove swamps, a number of patches seem similar to seawater. In Figure 10a–c, although these\\npatches show white tones, they are lower and sparser mangrove forests that are intermittently ﬂooded\\nby tides. Fortunately, these patches have positive values in the MFI image (Figure 10B). According to\\nMondal and Saha (2018), Dalhousie Island had 5950 ha of mangrove forests on 2015-08-03 [ 50]. In the\\nMFI image, the extent of mangrove extracted by the MFI is 6105 ha (pixels with positive MFI values),\\naccounting for 102% of Mondal and Saha’s result. Although the MSI image was captured during high\\ntide, almost all the local mangrove forests were detected by the MFI. According to Table 3, the overall\\naccuracy of this mangrove map is 96.8%, with a Kappa coe \\x0ecient of 0.93. In Dalhousie Island, the MFI\\nvalue of emerged mangrove forests, submerged mangrove forests, and water pixels range from 0.11 to\\n0.25, 0 to 0.10, and –0.03 to 0.\\nFigure 10.

Baia do Arraial, Amazon Coast, Brazil\\nBaia do Arraial is located along the south coasts of S ão Lu ís city, Brazil (Figure 11). The coastal\\nzone of S ão Lu ís is dominated by a semidiurnal tide; the high energy causes a maximum tidal height\\nof 8 m during the equinoctial spring tide. Therefore, numerous mangrove trees and shrubs would\\nbe submerged during high tides. As shown in Figure 11A, on 2018-06-14, patches in the northwest\\nand the middle of mangrove swamps were submerged; fortunately, these mangrove forests showed\\npositive values in Figure 11B, and the snapshot of Google Earth images conﬁrmed that these places\\nwere occupied by low mangrove forests. Therefore, we concluded that submerged mangrove forests\\nin Baia do Arraial could be detected by the MFI. According to Table 3, the overall accuracy of this\\nmangrove map is 91.7%, with a Kappa coe \\x0ecient of 0.83. In Baia do Arraial, the MFI values of emerged\\nmangrove forests, submerged mangrove forests, and water pixels range from 0.09 to 0.25, 0 to 0.09, and\\n\\x000.06 to 0.Remote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 13 of 17\\nFigure 11.

Advantages and Potential Applications of MFI\\nLocated along intertidal zones, mangrove forests are always relatively small patches; therefore,\\nmisclassiﬁcation of a small area would greatly a \\x0bect mapping results. The lack of full consideration\\nof tidal conditions would cause misclassiﬁcation between mangrove forests and water background.\\nTo accurately map and manage mangrove forests, in this study, we attempt to extract all mangrove\\nforests during local high tides. Undeniably, using VIs to extract mangrove forests is not new. All the\\ncommonly used indices are applicable to detecting emerged mangrove forests. However, during high\\ntides, according to our statistics in Figure 7, in LSWI, MNDWI, NDVI, and FAI images 27%, 8%, 19%,\\nand 5% of submerged pixels were mixed with water background. Furthermore, based on the result of\\nJensen–Shannon divergence, MFI greatly increased the distance of submerged mangrove forests and\\nwater. However, in the MFI image, nearly all the submerged pixels were completely separated from\\nthe water background. Furthermore, all traditional vegetation indices have a vital uncertainty, that\\nallow for the determination of the threshold of VIs. Fortunately, based on the theory of being above\\nthe baseline, one advantage of using the MFI in detecting mangrove forests is that the threshold is at\\nthe ﬁxed value of zero.\\nThis study provides an index built by Sentinel-2 MSI bands for discriminating submerged\\nmangrove forests from water background. It supports the ﬁndings of previous studies that the NIR\\nand red-edge provide great opportunities in discriminating between vegetation and water. Sentinel-2\\nMSI image contains ﬁve bands in NIR region, four of which were used to build the MFI. The FAI was\\nalso established based on baseline theory, but with one NIR band. However, according to Figure 7\\nand our statistics, unlike MFI (completely separated submerged mangrove forest and water), in the\\nFAI image, 5% of submerged mangrove forests pixels were mixed with water pixels. This is primarily\\nbecause unexpected ﬂuctuation in one NIR band could greatly a \\x0bect the value of the FAI. The four MSI\\nred-edge bands demonstrated relatively stable discrimination between submerged mangrove forest\\nand water.\\nTheoretically, the MFI concept can be applied to other sensors that contain spectral channels of red,\\nNIR, and SWIR, for example, the Landsat OLI sensor which has a red band ranging from 630 to 690 nm,\\nan NIR band ranging from 840 to 890 nm, and a SWIR band ranging from 2100 to 2300 nm. However,\\ndi\\x0berent sensors may acquire di \\x0berent MFI values due to the di \\x0berent ranges of red, NIR, and SWIR\\nbands. Furthermore, the performance of the Sentinel-2 MSI red-edge bands will also be present on\\nthe Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) sensor [ 51]. Therefore, the adaptability of\\nthe MFI to other remote sensing sensors still requires further examination. Moreover, the MFI was\\ndesigned based on the reﬂectance peak in the NIR spectral regions of green vegetation. Therefore,Remote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 14 of 17\\nthe MFI has great potential in detecting any submerged or emerged vegetation in aquatic environments,\\nsuch as ﬂoating algae and aquatic macrophytes. However, considering the various environments\\nwhere aquatic vegetation grows, the applicability of the MFI in detecting other aquatic vegetation still\\nwarrants further exploration.\\n4.2. Uncertainties Leading to Overestimation of Mangrove Forests Using the MFI\\nThis study demonstrates that there are abundant di \\x0berences in the spectral reﬂectance between\\nsubmerged mangrove forests and water bodies. In addition, the spectral curves of submerged and\\nemerged mangrove forests showed similar concave–convex characteristics (Figure 5). Therefore, the\\nMFI function can e \\x0eciently identify and detect mangrove forests from water background. However,\\nthe MFI was designed based on the reﬂectance peak between red and SWIR; any other vegetation that\\ncontains absorption signatures of chlorophyll in aquatic environment can also be detected [ 17,36,52].\\nHence, pixels containing ﬂoating vegetation (for example, algae) and other aquatic macrophytes (for\\nexample, Spartina alterniﬂora ) may be classiﬁed as mangrove forest. Additionally, due to limits in image\\nresolution, a small area of the water could still be classiﬁed as mangrove forests, due to having similar\\nspectral characteristics as nearby mangrove forests. These uncertainties can lead to overestimation of\\nmangrove forests by the MFI. In our application in Dalhousie Island, Sundarbans, India, the bias of\\narea of mangrove forests obtained by MFI is 2% larger.\\n4.3. Limitations Leading to Underestimation of Mangrove Forests Using the MFI\\nIn this study, MFI was created based on the typical reﬂectance curves of submerged mangrove\\nforests. However, the spectral curve of submerged mangrove forest can be a \\x0bected by several factors,\\nincluding water transparency (turbidity), distance that mangrove canopy under the water surface, and\\nthe coverage of mangrove forest [ 15]. Liew and Chang proved that the spectral curves of submerged\\nvegetation changes when water turbidity and depth change [ 53]. They demonstrated that with high\\nturbidity (50 nephelometric turbidity units), green vegetation could not be distinguished at a water\\ndepth of 0.5 m. In addition, with low turbidity (0.5 nephelometric turbidity units), typical vegetation\\nreﬂectance was undetectable at a water depth of 1 m. Chen et al. discovered that when submerged\\nvegetation coverage was less than 40%, it is di \\x0ecult to detect vegetation based on the NIR peak in\\nthe spectral reﬂectance curve [ 15]. Unfortunately, water ﬂow in mangrove swamps always has high\\nturbidity, and newly grown trees at the edge of mangrove forests always have low coverage. According\\nto our ﬁeld measurement, in Zhenzhu Harbor, submerged mangrove forests with a depth of 60 cm\\nunder the water surface would not be detected by MFI. Moreover, due to limits of image resolution,\\nsmall parts of the mangrove forests may be classiﬁed as water due to low tree coverage. As shown in\\nFigure 12, in Zhenzhu Harbor, low mangrove forests along tidal creeks were not identiﬁed by MFI.\\nThese limitations lead to underestimation of the areal extent of mangrove forests by the MFI.\\nFigure 12. Intermittently ﬂooded mangrove forests in local low tide period.\\n5. Conclusions\\nBased on the spectral response curves of submerged mangrove forests, a new vegetation index\\n(MFI) was developed to distinguish mangrove forests from the water background. To take fullRemote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 15 of 17\\nadvantage of the di \\x0berences in reﬂectance between submerged mangrove forests and the water\\nbackground, Sentinel-2 MSI bands, red and SWIR2 were selected to build a linear baseline, and the\\naverage reﬂectance value of four red-edge bands above the baseline was deﬁned as mangrove forest\\nindex (MFI). This new vegetation index is more advantageous in detecting submerged mangrove\\nforests than the traditional NDVI, LSWI, MNDWI, and FAI indices. According to the results of\\nJensen–Shannon divergence, MFI signiﬁcantly widens the distance of submerged mangrove forest and\\nwater pixels compared to other VIs (the Jensen-Shannon divergence values of MFI, FAI, NDVI, LSWI,\\nand MNDWI are 0.209, 0.077, 0.012, 0.003, and 0.121, respectively). Theoretically, 100% of submerged\\nmangrove forests could be extracted from MFI images. Practically, application of the MFI in three\\nglobal mangrove sites showed 99% to 102% of submerged mangrove forests were successfully extracted\\nfrom the MFI image. The overall accuracy of classiﬁcation results obtained from the MFI image ranged\\nfrom 91.7% to 97.6%. According to our ﬁeld measurements in Zhenzhu Harbor, MFI is insensitive to\\nmangrove forests with canopies under 60 cm of the water surface. There are some uncertainties and\\nlimitations, but the MFI was proven to be e \\x0bective in detecting the extent and condition of mangrove\\nforests from high-tide Sentinel MSI images. Although the repeatability and portability of the MFI is\\nstill a work in progress, this index brings great beneﬁts to remote sensing communities of coastal and\\naquatic vegetation studies.\\nAuthor Contributions: M.J. and Z.W. designed the research, process the data, and wrote the manuscript draft.\\nY.Z. helped with designed research and reviewed the manuscript.

Introduction\\nMangrove forests, which are found in saline coastal environ-\\nments around the tropical and subtropical latitudes, are among the\\nmost productive terrestrial ecosystems in the world ( Amarasinghe\\nand Balasubramaniam, 1992 ;Myint et al., 2008 ). These forests play\\nan important role in providing ecological and societal goods and\\nservices to local communities ( Wang et al., 2004 ;Giri and\\nMuhlhausen, 2008 ), including stabilizing shorelines and helping\\nreduce the devastating impact of natural disasters such as tsunamisand hurricanes ( Giri et al., 2007 ;Zhang et al., 2012 ), serving as\\nbreeding and nursing grounds for many marine and pelagic species\\n(Giri and Muhlhausen, 2008 ), and providing food, medicine, fuel,\\nand building materials as well as opportunities for aquaculture\\n(Thu and Populus, 2007 ;Myint et al., 2008 ). As a consequence,\\nmangrove ecosystems have attracted an increasing amount of\\nattention from land and ocean managers, conservation commu-\\nnities and academia. However, many mangrove communities,\\nespecially those in the developing regions, are currently being\\nsubjected to disturbances from a variety of sources, including un-\\ncontrolled encroachment due to increasing populations in coastal\\nareas, various destructive human activities (e.g., chemical spills) in\\nsurrounding catchments, tsunamis and other storms, and climate\\nchange ( Manson et al., 2003 ;Giri and Muhlhausen, 2008 ).Duke*Corresponding author.\\nE-mail address: nfulms@yahoo.com.cn (M.S.

(2007) recorded that in some regions, due to illegal logging,\\nmangroves have been declining at an alarming rate eperhaps\\ngreater than or equal to the declines in adjacent coral reefs or\\ntropical forests. Valiela et al. (2001) andWilkie and Fortuna (2003)\\nobserved that much of what remains from mangrove deforestation\\nstays in degraded condition. Further, Alongi (2008) argued that\\nmangrove stand composition and forest structure results from the\\ncomplex interplay of physiological tolerances and competitive in-\\nteractions, leading to a mosaic of interrupted or arrested succession\\nsequences, all of which are strongly impacted by physical/chemical\\ngradients and landform changes. Obviously, the mangroves around\\nthe world, especially those in the developing regions, are experi-\\nencing an intense spatio-temporal change. Regrettably, our un-\\nderstanding regarding the spatio-temporal dynamics and\\ncorresponding underlying drivers of change in most developing\\ncountries remains inadequate, in part because the mangrove\\ncommunities are changing at a rapid rate and because the changes\\nare very much site-speci ﬁc. These changes are occurring in\\nresponse to changing development and demographic pressure,\\nwhich run counter to the development of targeted strategies and\\npractices that promote the sustainable management of the existingmangroves.\\nChina ’s mangroves naturally occur along the southeast Chinese\\ncoastlines and in the provinces of Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi,\\nFujian and Taiwan, intermittently extending from 18\\n/C14Nt o2 7/C14N(Li\\nand Lee, 1997 ;Fu et al., 2009 ). Historically, half of China ’s mangrove\\nwetlands were distributed in Guangdong province ( Wang and\\nChen, 1998 ). It is notable that 80% of the mangroves of Guang-\\ndong province were located in Zhanjiang city. However, rapid urban\\nsprawl and an increasingly intensi ﬁed shrimp farming industry\\ntriggered by huge demographic and development pressure cata-\\nlyzed a drastic decline of mangroves, diminishing mangrove spatial\\nextent from 62 000 ha in the 1950 ’s to 15 000 ha in the late 1990 ’s\\n(Wang and Chen, 1998 ). Mangrove decline continued into the late\\n20st century. According to the latest inventory of mangrove re-\\nsources, mainland China had a total of 23 081.5 ha mangroves in\\n2008, 39.4% (9084 ha) of which existed in Guangdong province,\\noccupying the greatest area share ( Fu et al., 2009 ). Fortunately, with\\nthe establishment of mangrove national reserves since 1997 in\\nGuangdong province, continued mangrove afforestation and con-\\nservation efforts have expanded mangrove distribution to some\\nextent in certain protected areas. Due to the spatial extent and the\\nbiodiversity conservation priority of Guangdong ’s mangroves,\\nnumerous mangrove-oriented studies have been conducted there.\\nThese investigations primarily focused on the following aspects: (1)\\nmangrove wetlands protection and management ( Chen et al., 2004 ;\\nZhang et al., 2010 ), (2) mangrove community distribution ( Li et al.,\\n2002 ;Tang and Yu, 2007 ), (3) mangrove wetlands valuing ( Han\\net al., 2000 ), (4) birds in mangroves ( Zou et al., 2008 ;Wu, 2009 )\\nand (5) vegetation rehabilitation of mangroves ( Zheng et al., 1997 ,\\n2003 ). Furthermore, the analyses focused on mangrove protection\\nand management. Development and planning were mainly based\\non qualitative and descriptive methods, and there was a lack of\\nspatially explicit information on mangrove distribution and change.\\nFew investigations conducted in Guangdong province were focused\\non the spatio-temporal changes in mangrove distributions, and nostudies assessed mangrove fragmentation patterns. Thus, the rates,\\ncauses, and consequences of mangrove changes have not been\\nadequately documented. Such information would support the\\nstrategic development of sustainable mangrove management at\\ndiverse scales, and would be invaluable for assessing the effec-\\ntiveness of the existing mangrove management approaches. Hence,\\nmapping and monitoring mangrove dynamics in an accurate, reli-\\nable and ef ﬁcient fashion and providing spatially explicit infor-\\nmation on mangrove fragmentation are important to differentlevels of governments and conservation communities for effective\\nformulations of strategies and plans on mangrove management.\\nThe major objectives of this work were: (1) to derive land use\\ntime series data sets from multi-temporal Landsat observations for\\nGaoqiao and Yingzai mangrove areas, which are the two prototypes\\nof Zhanjiang National Mangrove Forest Nature Reserve, (2) to\\ncharacterize changes in mangrove distribution and fragmentation\\npatterns, and to (3) link the observed fragmentation trends to the\\nlocal biodiversity dynamics to provide insights, implications and\\ncountermeasures of mangrove sustainable management.\\n2. Data and study area\\nZhanjiang National Mangrove Forests Nature Reserve, due to the\\ndominance of mangroves in the area and its extremely high\\nbiodiversity signi ﬁcance, was chosen as our study site in the current\\nwork. This reserve is the largest national-level natural reserve for\\nmangrove protection in mainland China. The reserve was originally\\nestablished in 1991, and it was approved for elevation in rank to a\\nnational reserve by the State Council of China in 1997, in part\\nbecause of its importance for biodiversity conservation. The reservehas a notably rich ﬂora and fauna, and includes 28 mangrove spe-\\ncies, 139 ﬁsh species, 130 conch species, 133 insect species and 192\\nbird species. Of these, 25 species have been listed in national-level\\nconservation directories, 34 species are listed in the key conser-\\nvation lists of Guangdong province, and 82 species are listed in\\ndiverse international agreements directories ( Integrated Mangrove\\nManagement and Coastal Protection Program Of ﬁce, 2006 ).\\nParticularly, the Zhanjiang mangrove national natural reserve was\\ndeclared as a Ramsar site in January 2002, qualifying it as one of\\nthirty “Wetlands of International Importance ”in China. In recent\\nyears, mangrove coastlines have also become an attractive hotspot\\nfor eco-tourism and environmental education programs.\\nZhanjiang city covers a land area of 12 471 km2, supporting a\\ntotal population of around 7.0 million. The city is located at the\\nsouthernmost tip of Mainland China on Leizhou Peninsula in the\\nnorthern tropical zone spanning from 109/C14400E, 20/C14150Nt o\\n110/C14550E, 21/C14550N. The annual average temperature is about 23/C14and\\nthe coldest monthly average temperature of 17.2/C14occurs in January.\\nThe area receives abundant precipitation, with an average annual\\nprecipitation of about 1500 mm. The average tidal range is about\\n2.53 m, and the annual average temperature of the surface sea\\nwater is about 23.7/C14, with a salinity ranging from 29.7 &to 32.0&.\\nThe two prototype mangrove sites, Gaoqiao and Yingzai in Lian-\\njiang city ( Fig. 1 ), were identi ﬁed as our research targets in the\\ncurrent analysis mainly because both areas are dominated by\\nmangrove forests and have high levels of biodiversity.\\nSatellite imagery used in the work included ﬁve cloud-free\\nLandsat scenes: (1) MultiSpectral Scanner (MSS) scene, acquired\\non February 2, 1977, with a spatial resolution of 80 m; (2) Thematic\\nMapper (TM) scene, dated on October 30, 1991, with a resolution of\\n28.5 m; (3) Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM þ) scene, dated\\non October 30, 2000, 28.5 m resolution; (4) TM scene dated on\\nNovember 21, 2005, 30 m resolution and (5) TM scene, acquired onAugust 30, 2010, 30 m resolution. These scenes were downloaded\\nfrom the Global Land Cover Facility ( http://glcf.umiacs.umd.edu/\\nindex.shtml ) at the University of Maryland or the USGS EROS\\nData Center ( http://glovis.usgs.gov/ ). Additionally, a ﬁeld visit was\\nconducted from December 1 through 4, 2010 to (1) identify land use\\ntypes and mangrove disturbances in the two prototype areas, and\\n(2) to collect the administrative histories of the reserve and\\nbiodiversity change information through interviewing and\\nrecording aged people living near the reserve and local experts of\\nthe reserve. The 2001 mangrove thematic inventory data of\\nGuangdong province, and the mangrove afforestation statisticsM.S. Li et al. / Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 130 (2013) 111 e120 112were collected from the Guangdong Provincial Center for Forest\\nResources Monitoring. Socio-economic data and publications\\nrelated to mangrove management were also obtained from the\\nZhanjiang Mangrove Management and Protection Bureau. Vector-\\nized land use data sets for 1980 ’s, 1995, 2000 and 2005 covering the\\nstudy areas, developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)\\nwere also collected to support the analysis. True color air photo-\\ngraphs taken on July 13, 2000 and August 7, 2009, originally ac-\\nquired for local land use surveys, were also obtained from the localsurveying and mapping agency to validate the classi ﬁcations of this\\nanalysis.\\n3. Methods3.1. Image preprocessing\\nBefore classi ﬁcation, exoatmospheric re ﬂectance images (top of\\natmosphere re ﬂectance) for the ﬁve scenes were generated. This\\nFig. 1. Locations of the study sites. The red areas show our prototype study sites, Gaoqiao and Yingzai. (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is\\nreferred to the web version of this article.)M.S. Li et al. / Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 130 (2013) 111 e120 113was done by radiometrically calibrating the images using the latest\\npublished post-launch gain and offset constants to eliminate the\\nerrors caused by changes in sensor performance and characteristics\\nover time ( Chander et al., 2009 ). Due to the de ﬁciency in real-time\\nand complete pro ﬁles of atmosphere at the ﬁve time points, at-\\nmospheric corrections of the exoatmospheric re ﬂectance images\\nwere not implemented here. After that, the ﬁve scenes were\\ngeometrically corrected and resampled to a pixel size of 28.5 m\\nusing a 2-order polynomial equation built upon a total of 13 ground\\ncontrol points identi ﬁed from the local topographic map, with a\\nscale of 1 versus 10 000, with RMS less than 0.5 pixels. The local 3/C14\\nzonation Gauss-Kruger projection was speci ﬁed during the\\ngeometrical correction process.\\n3.2. Image classi ﬁcation\\nAfter extensive consultation with the local natural resource\\nmanagement experts and the established land use data, ﬁve land\\nuse and land cover types for the study sites were determined: (1)\\nmangrove, (2) intertidal zone or sandy area, (3) water, (4) aquafarm\\nfor shrimp and crab growing and (5) non-such (cropland, buildingsand roads). To derive actual land use maps, the unsupervised Iter-\\native Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique Algorithm (ISO-\\nDATA) was implemented to create 30 spectral clusters. This was\\nfollowed by the conversion from the spectral classes to the actual\\nland cover and land use classes by on-screen checking and labeling\\nin accordance with the objects ’locations, textures, tones or colors,\\nas well as the existing reference data (e.g., the thematic surveys of\\nmangrove and the land use data) and the inputs of the local experts.\\nPost-classi ﬁcations or further improvements to the classi ﬁcations\\nwere also made by eliminating apparent gross errors through hand\\nediting.\\n3.3. Assessing the accuracies of classi ﬁcation\\nOnce image classi ﬁcations were done, with the aid of the local\\nexperts for natural resources management, visual interpretation of\\nthe air photos taken in 2000 and 2009 was implemented to produce\\nthe reference data, which were used to validate the classi ﬁcation\\naccuracies of the Landsat images. The four-point historical land use\\ndata collected from the CAS were not used to assess the accuracies\\nbecause of their relative coarse resolutions (1 e0.1 million), and the\\n2001 thematic mangrove surveys were also excluded from the\\nvalidation processes due to their over-estimation of the mangrove\\ncoverage. The overall accuracies for the ﬁve identi ﬁed land use\\nclasses and the spatial agreement for the mangrove class were\\ncalculated respectively to assess the classi ﬁcations.\\n3.4. Modeling mangrove landscape fragmentation\\nPrior to modeling mangrove landscape fragmentation, the\\noriginal land cover and land use types were aggregated to focus on\\nthe patterns of forest (mangrove) versus non-forest (aquafarm and\\nnon-such) and missing values (intertidal zone plus water), to\\nfacilitate subsequent fragmentation modeling analysis. The missing\\nvalue class was not allowed to fragment the mangroves in thecurrent analysis. Based on the sliding window analysis technique,\\nthe forest fragmentation model outlined in Wade et al. (2003) was\\nused to develop spatially explicit maps depicting six forest frag-\\nmentation components (interior, perforated, edge, patch, transi-\\ntional and undetermined) at the analytical scale of 3 by 3 pixels.\\nThis model has been proven to be an effective alternative in char-\\nacterizing forest fragmentation at diverse scales ( Riitters et al.,\\n2000 ,2002 ;Wade et al., 2003 ). To run the model, two indices, P\\nf\\nand P ff, were derived beforehand, where P fis the proportion ofnonmissing pixels within the moving window with a speci ﬁed size\\nthat are forest, and P ffis the ratio of the number of pixel pairs in\\ncardinal directions that are both forest divided by the number of\\npixel pairs in cardinal directions where either one or both are\\nforested. Roughly, P ffmeasures the conditional probability that a\\npixel adjacent to a forest pixel is also forest. Once the P fand P ffwere\\navailable, each subject forest pixel centered within the moving\\nwindow was classi ﬁed into one of the six forest fragmentation\\ncategories described previously by applying the discriminant rules\\noutlined by Riitters et al. (2000) .\\n3.5. Bird surveys\\nMangrove fragmentation conditions were linked with changes\\nin biodiversity of the reserve using routinely collected bird popu-\\nlation survey data ( Integrated Mangrove Management and Coastal\\nProtection Program Of ﬁce, 2006 ;Wu, 2009 ). During the period\\n2002 to 2003, sampling was implemented during three periods\\nspanning three seasons: winter (December 23, 2002 to January 13,\\n2003), spring (March 3, 2003 to March 22, 2003) and summer (June\\n23, 2003 to July 10, 2003) to test the hypothesis that bird speciesrichness and abundance were equal over seasons. After 2005, bird\\nsurveys were carried out mainly in spring. The number of sampling\\nsessions was proportional to the area of mangrove, intertidal zone\\nand aquafarm at each site. A combination of point counts and\\ntransect counts were made for the intertidal zone, and 17 transects\\nwere set up in the mangroves ( Zou et al., 2008 ;Wu, 2009 ). Point\\ncount samplers documented all birds seen and heard within a 150-\\nm radius of designated center points during 10-min sampling pe-\\nriods. Transect counts were 50-m wide and 1000-m long. Average\\nsample time for each transect was about 120 min. Bird species and\\nnumbers seen or heard were recorded for all transects using\\nmethods described by Zou et al. (2001) . The time of day for sam-\\npling was selected based on tidal levels. Birds on intertidal zones\\nwere sampled during low tides when the zones were exposed and\\nbirds could access them. Birds in mangrove were sampled during\\nhigh tides when birds could not access intertidal zones. Binoculars\\n(10/C2) and spotting scopes (30 /C2and 60 /C2) were used for detecting\\nand identifying birds ( Zou et al., 2008 ).\\n4. Results4.1. Accuracy assessment\\nAfter interpreting the 2000 and 2009 air photos, the classi ﬁca-\\ntions derived from the Landsat scenes were evaluated. The overall\\naccuracies of the 2000 and 2010 classi ﬁcation results were esti-\\nmated at 92.3% and 89.7% respectively. The spatial agreement of\\nmangroves was identi ﬁed at 91.1% for 2000 and 90.3% for 2010. It\\nneeds to be noted that the air photos used were acquired for local\\nland use surveys and not exclusively for mangrove mapping. These\\nwere acquired at 11:23 AM, July 13, 2000 and at 11:47 AM, August 7,\\n2009. Similar to the Landsat observations, the air photos were\\ncollected when the local tides were relatively high. This helps\\nexplain why there was a relatively high spatial agreement of\\nmangroves derived from between the air photos and the Landsatscenes. Due to the unavailability of the reference data, we were\\nunable to quantitatively evaluate the classi ﬁcations for 1977, 1991\\nand 2005.\\n4.2. Changes in mangroves and aquafarm areas\\nFig. 2 shows the land use time series maps for Gaoqiao (left) and\\nYingzai (right). Associated area statistics derived from Fig. 2 are\\nsummarized in Fig. 3 . Mangroves in both Gaoqiao and YingzaiM.S. Li et al. / Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 130 (2013) 111 e120 114showed a similar trend characterized by a sharp decrease during\\nthe period 1977 e1991 giving way to an increase during the period\\n1991 to 2010 ( Fig. 3 ). Speci ﬁcally, mangrove estimates for Gaoqiao\\nand Yingzai were 145 ha and 53 ha in 1977, 69 ha and 42 ha in 1991,\\n354 ha and 157 ha in 2000, 381 ha and 242 ha in 2005, and 453 ha\\nand 353 ha in 2010, respectively. Aquaculture areas in the two sites\\nincreased during the period 1977 to 2005, then decreased ( Fig. 3 ).\\nIn detail, aquaculture areas were extremely scarce at both sites in\\n1977 ( Figs. 2 and 3). However, in 1991, 137 ha and 1769 ha of\\naquafarms were mapped in Gaoquio and Yingzai, respectively. In2000, aquaculture increased to 490 ha in Gaoqiao and 2439 ha in\\nYingzai, then continuously increased to 495 ha and 2526 ha,\\nrespectively, in 2005. During the period 2005 to 2010, Gaoqiao ’s\\naquaculture dropped to 274 ha and Yingzai ’s aquaculture decreased\\nto 1930 ha ( Fig. 3 ). Additionally, examination of Fig. 2 reveals that a\\nlarge-scale sandy area over Gaoqiao in 1977 was changed into\\nwater in 1991. Similarly, in Yinzai, sandy area was converted to\\nwater and aquafarms during the period 1977 e1991. After 1991,\\nthere was a clear trend of mangroves expanding into water at both\\nGaoqiao and Yingzai sites.\\nFig. 2. Changes in land uses during the period 1977 to 2010 over Gaoqiao (Left) and Yingzai (Right) sites, derived from classifying multi-temporal Landsat sc enes.M.S. Li et al. / Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 130 (2013) 111 e120 1154.3. Mangrove fragmentation patterns characterized by the\\nfragmentation model\\nAfter running the fragmentation model at the analytical win-\\ndow size of 3 by 3 pixels, mangrove fragmentation maps weregenerated ( Fig. 4 ) and associated statistics were summarized\\n(Fig. 5 ) to highlight the trends of mangrove fragmentation. At this\\nanalytical scale, interior and perforated components were abso-\\nlutely predominant over the other four fragmentation conditions at\\ntheﬁve time points. Apparently, acceleration in fragmentation of\\nmangroves occurred during the period 1977 e1991, followed by a\\ngradual deceleration in fragmentation during the period 1991 e\\n2010 ( Fig. 5 ). This pattern was evidenced by a fact that interior\\nmangrove forests of the two sites dropped sharply during the\\nperiod 1977 e1991, giving way to a gradual increase during the\\nperiod 1991 e2010. A continued but slight increase of the perfo-\\nrated component in Gaoqiao was observed during the whole period\\n1977e2010. However, in Yingzai, the perforated component ﬂuc-\\ntuated over time ( Fig. 5 ). Compared to the widely used geospatial\\nmetrics, such as, the patch size and the fractal dimensions, the\\nfragmentation maps provide more insights and implications to\\nmangrove management and biodiversity conservation practice due\\nto their spatially explicit information on fragmentation.\\n5. Discussion5.1. Satellite-based mangrove mapping affected by the local tidal\\nrhythms\\nMangrove forests are highly productive ecosystems that typi-\\ncally dominate the intertidal zone of tropical and subtropical\\ncoastlines ( Kathiresan and Bingham, 2001 ). Thus, mangrove dis-\\ntribution is undoubtedly dependent upon the local tidal rhythms\\nand varies with the changes of tidal inundation. The tidal rhythms\\nor periods over a particular place are fully determined by the lunar\\ncalendar (lunar gravity), which means that different dates in thelunar calendar will have different times for high versus low tides.\\nMeanwhile, the Landsat satellites pass over particular locations and\\nacquire data during extremely short time intervals, and depending\\non the day may acquire coastal data at high tide, low tide, or\\nsomewhere in between. Thus, mangrove distributions mapped by\\nsatellite remote sensing will be highly affected by the local tidal\\nlevels. The 2001 mangrove resource thematic inventory conducted\\nin Guangdong province revealed that a total of 700.9 ha mangroves\\nexisted in Gaoqiao and 388.1 ha in Yingzai. However, our estimates\\nderived from ETM þimagery dated on October 30, 2000 were at\\n381 ha in Gaoqiao and 157 ha in Yingzai, respectively. Obviously,there is a big discrepancy between the two sets of statistics. The\\nmost probable reasons responsible for the gaps are three-fold. First,\\ndifferences in tidal levels of the two surveys likely impacted results.\\nThe thematic survey of mangrove resources was conducted by on-\\nsite human delineation when the tide was low. Our remotelysensed observations were acquired at about 9:50 AM, October 30,\\n2000. According to the records from the local oceanic observatory\\nstation, on October 30, 2000, high tide occurred at 7:00 AM, with a\\ntidal height of 5.15 m and the low tide of 0.4 m occurred at 5:00 PM.\\nThe actual tidal height for the time when the satellite acquired data\\nwas about 3.73 m. Thus, a number of mangroves, especially the\\nstands consisting of young mangrove seedlings, were undoubtedly\\nﬂooded. This would have led to the mangrove area mapped by\\nsatellite imagery being far less than that collected from the ﬁeld\\nsurveys. Actually, Alongi (2008) ,Giri et al. (2007) and Liu et al.\\n(2008) have all noted the effects of tidal inundation on the\\nsatellite-based mangrove area estimates. Based on the available\\ntidal information, Liu et al. (2008) ignored the minor differences of\\ntriple-temporal tides and argued that the triple-temporal\\nmangrove classi ﬁcations based on Landsat observations were\\nroughly comparable. Due to the unavailability of the local tidal in-\\nformation, Giri et al. (2007 ,\\n2008 ) were unable to further explore\\nthe effects of tidal inundation on satellite-based mangrove map-\\nping. These existing studies and our current work collectively face a\\nchallenge that is how to minimize the impacts of different tidal\\nlevels upon the visibility of mangroves, or how to make the map-\\nping results comparable when using multi-temporal remotely\\nsensed observations, and the challenge also necessitates seeking\\nsubstitutes, for example, the aerial photography. A second reason\\nfor the discrepancies between our results and survey statistics\\nlikely relates to the differences in the years when measurements\\nwere made. The ground data from the thematic survey did not\\ncorrespond with the date of satellite data classi ﬁed, and there was a\\ntime lag of about one year between when the maps were made. It is\\nlikely that some mangrove afforestation occurred over the time\\nperiod between when our satellite data were acquired and when\\nthe survey was conducted. A third reason for discrepancies likely\\ninvolved differences in measurement scales. The thematic surveywas implemented from extensive ﬁeld visits. Field manual de-\\nlineations of mangrove patches usually overestimates mangrove\\narea due to errors of human vision obstacles (e.g. obstructed sight)\\nand de ﬁciency in reference objects throughout the ﬂat intertidal\\nzones. For example, human delineation of the mangroves often\\nincludes mangroves and their adjacent water bodies and sandy\\nareas, which leads to an overestimation. This was likely the case,\\nand Giri et al. (2007) also made the same observation when\\nmonitoring mangrove dynamics of the Sundarbans in BangladeshFig. 3. Areal changes in mangroves and aquaculture areas over Gaoqiao and Yingzai sites.M.S. Li et al. / Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 130 (2013) 111 e120 116and India. It should also be noted that our satellite-based deriva-\\ntions resulted from interpreting 30-m resolution spectral images.\\nUndoubtedly, existence of mixed pixels led to some areal errors,\\nespecially in areas that had diverse land use types. For example, the\\nthematic ﬁeld survey certainly included newly-established\\nmangrove seedling patches in their maps. However, the LandsatTM sensor was spectrally unable to discriminate these areas\\nadequately due to their relative low crown closure in the dominant\\ncontext of water.\\nMapping mangroves is still a challenging task due to a variety of\\nreasons, such as low accessibility of the intertidal zones, and\\nchanging tidal levels. It is relatively rare that we have access to\\nFig. 4. Spatio-temporal dynamics of mangrove fragmentation, derived from implementing the fragmentation model at the analytical scale of 3 by 3 pixels.M.S. Li et al. / Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 130 (2013) 111 e120 117satellite remotely sensed data acquired at the absolute lowest tides\\nwhen mangrove mapping is optimal. Meanwhile, clouds and at-\\nmospheric properties can diminish the potential number of optimal\\nscenes to analyze. Thus, satellite-based approaches tend to under-\\nestimate mangrove distribution. Aerial photography can effectively\\nadapt to the local tidal cycles by selectively targeting acquisitions of\\ndata at times of low tide. In addition, it is generally easier to work\\naround clouds and atmospheric problems with aerial photograph\\nacquisitions. Meanwhile, the problems typically encountered with\\nﬁeld surveys (e.g. human site obstructions) can be minimized\\nthrough air photo analysis. Hence, to accurately map or monitor\\nmangrove dynamics in a particular place, aerial photography can be\\nan efﬁcient and ﬂexible alternative.\\n5.2. Biodiversity and environmental implications of mangrove\\nfragmentation\\nThe amount of mangroves present generally determines the\\nmangroves located in either interior or edge. The relative ratio of\\ninterior over edge provides a measure of mangrove ecosystem\\nhealth. Different mangrove conditions have signi ﬁcant impacts on\\nthe distributions of mangrove-dependent organisms, such as birds.\\nFor example, Wu (2009) argued that the intact interior mangrove\\nareas were quite suitable for birds because they should afford better\\nprotection against capture than small forest patches. Although\\nfragmentation components or categories can serve as spatial in-\\ndicators for assessing whether critical components or functions ofmangroves are being maintained, mangrove edges and perforations\\nhave less value where the amount of forest is low ( Soledad and\\nSantiago, 2005 ). This is especially true because isolation can easily\\noccur when the mangrove landscape is highly fragmented, affecting\\nbiological exchanges throughout the mangroves. Particularly, some\\nground-nesting birds will be signi ﬁcantly affected by the distance\\nbetween mangrove patches ( Uezu et al., 2005 ). The increasing\\nisolation of mangrove patches may also have substantial impacts on\\nsome threatened species by reducing the genetic ﬂow between\\nsubpopulations. Sometimes, investigators have suggested that we\\nplace more attention on the perforated condition rather than“patch ”, because the places most likely to exhibit qualitative future\\nchanges will not be in the region of existing patches, but in the\\nsurrounding halo of perforated forest ( Riitters et al., 2000 ). The\\nexisting fragmented areas, for instance, the “edge ”and perforated\\nmangroves mapped by the model, will be more easily further\\ndegraded and fragmented due to erosion, siltation, sedimentation\\nand anthropogenic disturbances due to their high accessibility. Thus,\\nit is emphasized that conservation and oceanic management stra-\\ntegies should always consider the quality of the whole mangrove\\nlandscape and especially the number of different mangrove habitats\\nand their spatial arrangement ( Steiner and Köhler, 2003 ).\\nThe fragmentation model used in this study enabled generation\\nof a suite of spatially explicit fragmentation maps that are effective\\nfor assessing mangrove restoration potential. These maps can help\\nto spatially convey decision-makers ’recommendations on conser-\\nvation strategies. For instance, this information can be used to plan\\nthe expansion of the interior condition and to ﬁll in the perforated\\nregions, or to reduce vulnerability by better managing the places\\nnear the critical thresholds set by the percolation theory. Human-\\ncontrolled activities, including identifying the proper sites and\\napproaches of mangrove logging, regeneration, afforestation, as\\nwell as chemical spill controlling activities, are the typical measures\\nthat can be assessed from adequately utilizing the spatial frag-\\nmentation pattern information provided by the model. Through\\nproviding the spatial fragmentation information from the model,\\ntheﬁndings in the current analysis will be helpful for mangrove\\nlandscape management by guiding the scienti ﬁc development of\\nutilization and conservation strategies.\\nLocated in one of the East Siberian-Australasian ﬂ\\nyways,\\nattracting a variety of migrating birds and resident birds to rest,\\nforage and breed, Zhanjiang National Mangrove Forest Natural\\nReserve is referred to as “the heaven of birds ”and plays an\\nextremely important role in biodiversity conservation, particularly\\nbird biodiversity ( Liu and Li, 2001 ;Liu, 2007 ;Zou et al., 2008 ;Wu,\\n2009 ). Currently, monitoring the dynamics of bird populations,\\nespecially the waterfowl, has been routine at the reserve. Changes\\nin bird species and population numbers may be an effective mea-\\nsure of mangrove quantity, quality and fragmentation conditionsGao qiao\\n01020304050\\n1977 1991 2000 2005 2010\\nTimeAreal percentage(%)Interior\\nPerforated\\nEdge\\nPatch\\nTransitional\\nUndetermined\\nYingzai\\n01020304050607080\\n1977 1991 2000 2005 2010\\nTi meAreal percentage(%)Interior\\nPerforated\\nEdge\\nPatch\\nTrans itional\\nUndetermined\\nFig. 5. Comparative patterns of the six mangrove fragmentation components, during the period 1977 to 2010.M.S. Li et al. / Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 130 (2013) 111 e120 118and are of local economic interest. For example, the price of the teal\\n(Anas crecca ), a mangrove-dependent local waterfoul species, went\\nup to 200 Yuan RMB (1 US Dollar equals to 6.3 Yuan RMB currently)\\ndriven by the Cantonese desire to eat the teal. Thus, the illegal\\ncapture and selling of the teal frequently occurred, leading to a\\nsharp decline of the teal population of the mangrove reserve.\\nInterestingly, staff at the reserve witnessed that the teal started to\\ngather in the core portions of the mangrove reserve to avoid from\\ncapture in recent years. Thus, increase in mangrove coverage or\\nreduction in mangrove fragmentation will provide the teal better\\nprotection. Another fully opposite case involves the ﬁddler crabs\\n(Uca arcuata ). Due to its low edibility and the over-feeding when\\ngrowing in association with the shrimp and crabs being aqua-\\nfarmed it population showed a marked increase during the past ten\\nyears. The ﬁddler crabs prefer the edge and perforated components\\nof the mangroves to obtain more sunshine, wind and movement\\nopportunities ( Integrated Mangrove Management and Coastal\\nProtection Program Of ﬁce, 2006 ).\\nDue to diverse beach development programs, especially the\\nconstruction of shrimp and crab farms, mangrove forests have\\nshrunk gradually, leading to a sharp decline in livable mangrovehabitats during the period 1977 to 1991 ( Figs. 2 and3).Thampanya\\net al. (2006) also observed the same phenomenon in Thailand and\\nconcluded that mangrove loss was higher in the presence of shrimp\\nfarms and in areas where mangrove forests used to be extensive in\\nthe past. Additionally, owing to a long-term unlawful discharge of\\nthe industrial wastewater and domestic sewage, and an over-use of\\nﬁsh bait, eutrophication of the coastal water has intensi ﬁed. This\\nhas posed a serious threat to mangrove habitats and has contrib-\\nuted to a disappearance of swans ( Cygnus spp.) over the past ﬁfteen\\nyears and an acute reduction of raptors such as the kestrel ( Falco\\ntinnunculus ), and black-winged kite ( Elanus caeruleus ). Since 2005,\\nwaterfowl species and numbers within the reserve have increased\\ngradually in response to gradual improvement of the mangrove\\nfragmentation and degradation conditions observed. Speci ﬁcally,\\nChinese pond-heron ( Ardeola bacchus ), great egret ( Ardea alba ) and\\nblack-collared starling ( Sternus nigricollis ) populations have\\nincreased by 10 e20%, and spot-necked dove ( Streptopelia chinensis )\\nhas increased by about 30%. The observed increase is principally\\nattributed to the expansion of mangroves and the observed\\nreduction of mangrove fragmentation, and the reinforcement of the\\nenvironmental protection awareness of local dwellers, catalyzed by\\ndiverse programs for mangrove reforestation and conservation and\\neducational programs executed. A bird survey for Gaoqiao (one of\\nthe mangrove study sites) summarized in Table 1 suggests that\\nmangrove conservation practice at this site has signi ﬁcantly\\nimproved the quality of mangrove habitats and attracted greater\\nnumbers birds to reproduce ( Zou et al., 2008 ;Wu, 2009 ). It is clear\\nthat since 2005, the number of bird species and the total numbers\\nof birds have gradually increased and the individual populations\\nhave expanded over time. Particularly, the ﬁrst appearance of the\\nworld ’s endangered species, black-faced spoonbill ( Platalea minor) ,\\nin April 2006 at the Gaoqiao site, is highly notable. This bird species\\nwas found again in January 2008. Emergence of this particularendangered bird species twice signi ﬁcantly improved the interna-\\ntional status of the reserve and further promoted the protection\\nefforts of birds. Wu (2009) conducted a systematic survey on\\nwaterfowl throughout the mangrove forests of Zhanjiang and also\\nfound a similar trend in bird numbers as we have presented here.\\nSpeci ﬁcally, the number of waterfowl for 2005, 2006, 2008 and\\n2009 observed were 1272, 2173, 2377 and 3338 respectively, and\\nthe number of waterfowl species was recorded at 24, 28, 20 and 31\\naccordingly. Clearly, these ﬁndings are fully consistent with our\\nobservations in Gaoqiao. The above-mentioned observations on\\nbiodiversity (mainly birds) help demonstrate the signi ﬁcance of\\nexpanding the interior component of mangroves. Healthy\\nmangrove forests provide adequate breeding and nursing grounds,\\nfood and shelter for birds. Therefore, expanding the distribution of\\nmangroves, mitigating the fragmentation of mangroves via affor-\\nestation, conservation and education programs are important for\\nbiodiversity conservation in Zhanjiang mangrove reserve.\\n5.3. Uncertainties\\nClassi ﬁcations of satellite imagery into land cover and land use\\ntypes always have a certain degree of error and uncertainty asso-\\nciated with them. Analyses of mangroves change and fragmenta-\\ntion patterns of the present study are undoubtedly affected by\\nerrors in the classi ﬁcations. Obviously, commission errors and\\nomission errors, commonly found in the image classi ﬁcations, will\\ncause some level of inaccuracy of the mangrove area statistics and\\ndistributions. Particularly, the 1977 land use maps were derived\\nfrom the MSS images with a spatial resolution of 80 m and four\\nspectral bands. Classifying the MSS images likely resulted in a\\n“lower quality ”classi ﬁcation product as compared with those\\nderived from the TM/ETM þscenes, which have seven spectral\\nbands with a 30-m resolution. We need to recognize the dif ﬁculties\\nin obtaining consistent satellite data for a long-term time series\\ninvestigations. In the current work, we had a time span of about 33\\nyears (1977 e2010) and the TM/ETM þimages did not cover the\\nentire time interval. Thus, we had to use the lower-quality MSS\\nimages to help ﬁll in the time span in order to better detect the\\ntrends of mangrove coverage change. Nonetheless, it should be\\nnoted that there were not many mangroves in the 1970 ’s in this\\narea to classify, and we believe that our MSS classi ﬁcation\\nadequately captured the distribution patterns of the mangroveforests that existed in the area for the purposes of the investigation.\\nThe fragmentation model used in the analysis is based on the P\\nff\\nvalue (connectivity) and the P f(forest area density). The outcomes\\n(fragmentation maps) derived from the model will be highly related\\nto the connectivity of pixels, which is closely dependent upon the\\naccuracy of the classi ﬁcations. Furthermore, the fragmentation\\nmodel is scale-dependent and threshold-dependent ( Riitters et al.,\\n2000 ), which implies that a proper analytical scale and threshold\\nshould be cautiously speci ﬁed after an intensive assessment of the\\nproperties of the speci ﬁc study case coupled with the percolation\\ntheory. In addition, the current analysis was unable to separate the\\nyounger mangrove stands from the mature stands, and the dense\\nTable 1\\nChanges in bird species and population sizes at Gaoqiao site, which were adapted from Wu (2009) coupled with the daily records of the reserve.\\nYear Number of bird\\nspeciesNumber of birds Population 1 Population 2 Population 3\\n2005 7 169\\n2008 9 2312009 17 475 Little Egret ( Egretta rzetta ) 208 Ringed Plover ( Charadrius.dubius )5 9\\n2010 19 675 Little Egret (Egretta garzetta) 273 Black-headed Gull ( Larus ridibundus ) 102 Green-winged Teal\\n(Anas crecca )5 9M.S.

Conclusions\\nThis work has successfully characterized the spatio-temporal\\nchanges in mangrove distribution and fragmentation patterns\\nthrough interpreting multi-temporal Landsat observations and\\nimplementing a fragmentation model in the Zhanjiang National\\nMangrove Forests Natural Reserve. The socio-economic drivers\\nresponsible for the observed changes were also examined. Partic-\\nularly, the linkages between mangrove fragmentation and biodi-\\nversity conservation (mainly birds) were highlighted to emphasize\\nthe signi ﬁcance of expanding the distribution of mangroves, miti-\\ngating the fragmentation of mangroves via afforestation, and con-\\nservation and education programs. We believe that the derived\\nfragmentation patterns and trends will help develop strategic plans\\non sustainable management important to mangrove and biodi-\\nversity conservation.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThis work was jointly funded by the special fund project for the\\nscienti ﬁc research of the forestry public welfare industry (No.\\n201304208) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China\\n(Grant No: 31270587, 30972297).

Research shows that mangrove conservation may be a low-cost means of reducing CO\\n2emissions. Accordingly, there is growing interest in developing\\nmarket mechanisms to credit mangrove conservation projects for associated CO 2emissions\\nreductions. These efforts depend on robust and readily applicable, but currently unavailable,localized estimates of soil carbon. Here, we use over 900 soil carbon measurements, collected in 28countries by 61 independent studies, to develop a global predictive model for mangrove soil\\ncarbon. Using climatological and locational data as predictors, we explore several predictive\\nmodeling alternatives, including machine-learning methods. With our predictive model, weconstruct a global dataset of estimated soil carbon concentrations and stocks on a high-resolutiongrid (5 arc min). We estimate that the global mangrove soil carbon stock is 5.00 ± 0.94 Pg C(assuming a 1 meter soil depth) and ﬁnd this stock is highly variable over space. The amount of\\ncarbon per hectare in the world ’s most carbon-rich mangroves (approximately 703 ± 38 Mg C ha\\n−1)\\nis roughly a 2.6 ± 0.14 times the amount of carbon per hectare in the world ’s most carbon-poor\\nmangroves (approximately 272 ± 49 Mg C ha−1). Considerable within country variation in\\nmangrove soil carbon also exists. In Indonesia, the country with the largest mangrove soil carbon\\nstock, we estimate that the most carbon-rich mangroves contain 1.5 ± 0.12 times as much carbonper hectare as the most carbon-poor mangroves. Our results can aid in evaluating bene ﬁts from\\nmangrove conservation and designing mangrove conservation policy. Additionally, the results canbe used to project changes in mangrove soil carbon stocks based on changing climatologicalpredictors, e.g. to assess the impacts of climate change on mangrove soil carbon stocks.\\nSOnline supplementary data available from stacks.iop.org/ERL/9/104013/mmedia\\nKeywords: mangroves, blue carbon, REDD, soil carbon, ecosystem services, predictive\\nmodeling\\n1. Introduction\\nMangroves have long been recognized for the broad range of\\necosystem services they provide, including serving as primarynursery habitat for many species of ﬁs h ,c r u s t a c e a n s ,b i r d s ,a n d\\nmarine mammals, and protecting coastal communities from\\ncoastal erosion and damage from storms and other natural\\nhazards (Mumby et al 2004 ,S p a l d i n g et al 2010 ,T w i l l e y\\net al 1996 , Shepard et al 2011 ). More recently, mangroves\\nhave also received attention for their capacity to store large\\nv o l u m e so fc a r b o n( D o n a t o et al 2011 , Pendleton et al 2012 ,\\nSiikamäki et al 2012 ) .F o re x a m p l e ,o na v e r a g e ,m a n g r o v e s\\ncontain three to four times the mass of carbon typically foundEnvironmental Research Letters\\nEnviron.

Much of this carbon storage, however, is at risk of\\nbeing lost, because mangroves are among the most threatedand rapidly vanishing ecosystems globally, with habitat lossrates similar or greater to those in tropical forests (UN Foodand Agricultural Organization 2007 ,V a l i e l a et al 2001 ).\\nRecent studies point to mangrove conservation as a\\npotentially low-cost option for reducing CO\\n2emissions\\n(Pendleton et al 2012 , Siikamäki et al 2012 ). For example,\\nSiikamäki et al (2012 )ﬁnd that in most mangrove areas of the\\nworld, protecting mangroves achieves emissions reductions ata lower cost than reducing emissions elsewhere in the econ-omy. Accordingly, there is growing interest in developing andimplementing market-based mechanisms such as carbon off-\\nsets, to credit mangrove conservation for associated emissions\\nreductions, using a framework similar to the REDD (reducedemissions from deforestation and degradation) programsdesigned to protect tropical forests. The purpose of theseprograms is to provide market incentives to reduce emissionsfrom deforestation by, for example, encouraging developingcountries to reduce deforestation in return for compensationfrom developed countries committed to emission reductions\\n(Angelsen 2008 , Kindermann et al 2008 ).\\nDesigning and evaluating market mechanisms for man-\\ngrove conservation requires several spatially explicit scienti ﬁc\\ninputs, including information on the mangrove area susceptibleto deforestation, carbon in mangrove biomass and soils, annualcarbon sequestration, the emissions pro ﬁles of mangroves\\nconverted to other uses, and the opportunity cost of protectingmangroves (Siikamäki et al 2013 ). A growing number of\\nresearchers have recognized the need for more and better sci-\\nence and are calling for continued research on the potential toinclude mangrove conservation in climate change policy (e.g.Mcleod et al2011 , Pendleton et al2012 , Siikamäki et al2013 ).\\nA key challenge in assessing the carbon bene ﬁts from\\nmangrove conservation is the lack of rigorous spatial estimatesof mangrove soil carbon stocks. Unlike other tropical forests,for which the bulk of carbon storage is in biomass, mangrove\\ncarbon is primarily stored in the soil. For example, Donato et al\\n(2011 ) estimate that soil carbon comprises 49 –98% of carbon\\nin mangrove forests. Siikamäki et al (2012 ) developed the ﬁrst\\nspatial estimates of global mangrove soil carbon, using countryand regional level mean estimates of soil carbon concentrationsderived from the literature. While this provides an importantﬁrst step, the estimates do not capture the ﬁne-scale variation in\\nmangrove soil carbon concentrations and, therefore, the ﬁne-\\nscale variation in potential bene ﬁts from mangrove conserva-\\ntion in different locations.\\nWe address this data gap by developing a predictive\\nmodel of mangrove soil carbon to estimate global mangrovesoil carbon concentrations (mg C cm\\n−3) and stocks (Pg C) on\\na high-resolution grid (5 arc min). Our predictive model isbased on soil carbon measurements compiled in the meta-analyses by Chmura et al (2003 ), Kristensen et al (2008 ), and\\nDonato et al (2011 ). These three studies combined include\\ndata from over 900 samples collected in 28 countries, whichcontain 64.4% of global mangroves. We explore severalprediction methods, including machine-learning algorithms,to assess the generalizability and predictive performance of\\nalternative model speci ﬁcations.\\nOurﬁndings contribute to the science needed to accurately\\nquantify the bene ﬁts from emissions reductions achieved with\\nmangrove conservation. Combining results from our predictivemodel with information on the spatial distribution of above-\\nground biomass (e.g. Hutchison et al 2013 ) enables improved\\nestimation of the magnitude and spatial distribution of man-grove carbon storage, thereby aiding the design and evaluationof mangrove conservation projects. Additionally, because weﬁnd that climatological factors are important predictors of\\nmangrove soil carbon concentrations, our predictive model canbe helpful in assessing the impacts of climate change onmangrove carbon storage.\\n2. Methods\\n2.1. Data\\nWe use mangrove soil carbon measurements from meta-\\nanalyses by Chmura et al (2003 ), Kristensen et al (2008 ), and\\nDonato et al (2011 ). Combining data from these sources, after\\nremoving observations where the study location is notdocumented, yields a total of 932 samples that were collectedin 28 countries by 61 independent studies. The locations ofthe soil carbon samples are shown in ﬁgure 1.\\nObservations included in Chmura et al (2003 ) and\\nDonato et al (2011 ) are measurements of the soil carbon bulk\\ndensity, while Kristensen et al (2008 ) record the per cent\\norganic carbon (POC) of each soil sample. To combine theobservations, we convert POC measurements into bulk den-sity measurements following Donato et al (2011 ) with the\\nestimated relationship:\\n=−poc 3.0443bd , (1)1.313\\nwhere poc is the per cent weight of organic carbon in the soiland bd is the soil bulk density measured in grams per cubic\\ncentimeter. We then use the soil bulk density to calculate the\\nsoil carbon content in g C per cubic centimeter.\\nWe combine the soil carbon dataset with information on\\nseveral predictor variables that explain the carbon con-centration in mangrove soils, including the distance of theobservation ’s sampling location from the equator (the abso-\\nlute value of latitude coordinates to a 0.1 of a degree), severalvariables describing climate conditions at the sampling loca-\\ntions, and regional indicators. The data are available in the\\nonline supplementary materials at stacks.iop.org/ERL/9/\\n104013/mmedia .\\nFor the majority of the soil carbon data (76% of the\\nobservations), source studies report precise locational data,i.e. latitude coordinates reported to the 0.1 of a degree, whichwe are able to use directly. In some instances (9% of theobservations), a group of soil carbon samples were taken from\\nneighboring sites and only the boundary latitude and long-\\nitude coordinates are provided. In these cases we use themean latitude coordinate value for each of the soil carbonestimates in that study. In studies where only imprecise\\n2Environ. Res. Lett. 9(2014) 104013 S L Jardine and J V Siikamäkilocational data were provided, but a detailed map of the\\nsample location was included (13% of the observations), wemanually obtain a more precise location. Finally, wherelocational data were reported in the meta-analysis but could\\nnot be veri ﬁed (e.g. unpublished data), we use the locational\\ndata reported in the meta-analysis (2% of the observations).The latitude data are used to calculate distance from the\\nequator, which has been linked to mangrove productivity\\n(Twilley et al 1992 ), and therefore may be an important\\npredictor of mangrove soil carbon, a hypothesis which we testin our analysis.\\nClimate variables are from the WorldClim Bioclim data\\n(Hijmans et al 2005 ). Of the 19 variables included in the\\nBioclim data, we use mean annual temperature (Bioclim 1),mean temperature in the coldest quarter (Bioclim 11), total\\nannual precipitation (Bioclim 12), and seasonality in pre-\\ncipitation (Bioclim 15). Our choice of climate variables ismotivated by a large body of literature linking mangroveproductivity with temperature and precipitation (Ellison 2003 ,\\nField 1995 , McKee 1993 ) and extreme cold events (Cava-\\nnaugh et al 2013 , Snedaker 1995 , Woodroffe and Grin-\\ndrod 1991 ), implying that these climate variables should be\\nincluded in our model.\\nFinally, we include regional indicators, where regions are\\ndeﬁned according to the ten biogeographic regions for man-\\ngroves developed by Spalding et al (2010 ) (see the SI for\\ncountries represented in the data from each region). Our\\ngeographic predictors (distance from the equator and regional\\nindicators) control for the impacts of unobserved factors onthe carbon concentration in mangrove soils, to the extent towhich the unobserved factors vary over space. For example,\\nmangrove soil carbon has been linked to allochthonous riv-\\nerine or marine material, allochthonous production of algae,and phytoplankton (Bouillon et al 2003 , Kennedy et al 2004 ,\\nMarchand et al 2003 ) and tidal forcing (Kristensen et al 2008 )\\namong other things, all of which are unobserved but likely\\nvary systematically over space. Additionally, becausemangrove species are more homogeneous within mangrove\\nbioregions (Spalding et al 2010 ), mangrove soil carbon\\nconcentrations may also be more homogeneous within man-grove bioregions, which we control for with regionalindicators.\\n2.2. Predictive models\\nWe develop two classes of statistical models to predict soilcarbon concentrations, including parametric predictive mod-els and models developed with machine learning algorithms.Constructing a robust predictive model requires balancing theability to explain the most variation in the data sample with\\nthe model ’s generalizability, i.e. its ability to predict out of\\nsample (Babyak 2004 ). We evaluate the alternatives models\\nalong these two dimensions.\\n2.3. Parametric prediction\\nWeﬁrst develop a parametric predictive model with regres-\\nsion analysis. Speci ﬁcally, we estimate the following model:\\nαθ β δ ϵ =+ + + + climate sc avlatitude region , (2)ii i i i\\nwhere sciis soil carbon content in sampling location i,\\navlatitudeiis the absolute value of latitude for location i\\n(distance from the equator), climateiis a vector containing all\\nBioclim variables for site iand a squared term for average\\nannual temperature based on evidence of a nonlinear rela-tionship between mangrove soil carbon and temperature (e.g.Gilman 2008), and\\nϵiis an assumed mean-zero normally\\ndistributed random error. We estimate several speci ﬁcations\\nof equation ( 2), where certain parameters or sets of parameters\\nare constrained to equal zero. The model is estimated usingordinary least squares (OLS).\\nWe compare the parametric predictive models based on\\nR-squared statistics, signaling in-sample predictive power,and the Akaike information criterion (AIC), indicating modelgeneralizability as it relates to model simplicity.\\nFigure 1. Locations of soil carbon concentration measurement data from the meta-analyses by Chmura et al (2003 ), Kristensen et al (2008 ),\\nand Donato et al (2011 ).\\n3Environ. Res. Lett. 9(2014) 104013 S L Jardine and J V Siikamäki2.4. Machine learning prediction\\nMachine-learning (ML) algorithms offer an alternative to\\nsingle-equation parametric predictive modeling. They involvesystematic computational learning in the model-buildingprocess, which improves the model ’s the predictive perfor-\\nmance and generalizability by minimizing over ﬁtting. The\\nML methods used here are also ﬂexible in modeling non-\\nlinearities and/or interactions between the predictors. MLalgorithms are especially useful in instances where the func-tional relationship between the outcome variable and thepredictors is unknown, as is the case with mangrove soilcarbon concentrations (Kristensen et al 2008 ). ML methods\\nhave a long history in the ﬁeld of medical biosciences\\n(Kononenko 2001 ) and are rapidly gaining ground in several\\nﬁelds ranging from economics (Varian 2013 ), to conservation\\nbiology and ecology (Gomes 2009 , Dietterich 2009 ).\\nWe examine two ML algorithms as potential alternatives\\nto our parametric predictive model of mangrove soil carbon: aboosted decision tree (DT) model and a bag DT model (seeHastie et al 2009 and Breiman 1996 for a detailed description\\nof the two methods respectively). Both are tree-based meth-\\nods, which are well suited for complex ecological data\\n(De ’ath and Fabricius 2000 ), but the relative performance of\\neach method depends on the dataset (Quinlan 1996 ).\\nInputs to the ML models are identical to those in the\\nparametric model. To compare the two ML algorithms withour parametric model, we test the out-of-sample predictivepower of each model. In the out-of-sample prediction tests,weﬁrst draw 1 000 datasets by taking random samples of 30\\nstudies (and all observations from those studies) from our\\noriginal dataset, without replacement. Next, we estimate themachine learning and parametric predictive models for eachof the 1 000 datasets. Finally, we use the estimated models topredict soil carbon concentrations for observations in theremaining 31 studies for each of the 1 000 datasets and cal-culate prediction errors. The magnitude of prediction errors\\nindicates how sensitive the model is to the studies included in\\nour analysis. All models were ﬁtted in MATLAB (2013)\\nversion 8.1.0.604, using the ﬁtensemble package in the sta-\\ntistics toolbox.3. Results\\n3.1. Parametric prediction\\nRegression results are reported in table 1. We begin with a\\nsimple constant-only model showing that the mean soil car-\\nbon content in our sample is 32.14 mg cm−3(min.\\n13.48 mg cm−3, and max. 115 mg cm−3), or approximately an\\naverage of 321 Mg (tons) C ha−1in the top meter of soil. We\\ngradually add controls to the model and ﬁnd that climatic\\nvariables are signi ﬁcant predictors of mangrove soil carbon as\\nare the regional controls. The regional controls contributesubstantially to the explanatory power of the model. For\\nexample, the R-squared for Model 3 with climatic variables\\nbut no regional controls ( ﬁxed effects) is 0.103, but after\\nadding the regional controls the R-squared is 0.912 (Model\\n4). Adding regional controls also lowers the AIC, suggesting\\nthat over ﬁtting is not driving the increased R-squared statistic.\\nFigure 2(left panel) shows the mean soil carbon by\\nregion, and the 95% con ﬁdence intervals around the means,\\nwith and without controls for climate and distance from the\\nequator. Uncontrolled regional means are obtained by\\nregressing soil carbon concentrations on the full set ofregional indicator variables without any other controls. The\\ndata show that mangroves in North and Central America\\ncontain some of the most carbon-rich soils whereas man-\\ngroves in East Asia are among the most carbon-poor soils.\\nSoils in South East Asia, where a large fraction of the world ’s\\nmangroves are located (approx. 32.8%), have considerably\\ngreater carbon content than mangroves soils in East Asia butsubstantially less carbon content than mangrove soils in North\\nand Central America. However, regional constants are no\\nlonger statistically different from each other after controlling\\nfor climate and latitude (right panel of ﬁgure 2).\\nModel 4, which controls for latitude, climatic conditions,\\nand sample region, outperforms all other parametric predic-tions explored here in terms of attaining the highest R-squared\\nand lowest AIC. Therefore, we select it as our preferred\\nparametric speci ﬁcation and compare it to the two ML\\nmodels.Figure 2. Regional variation in soil carbon. The left panel shows regional means without controls for climate and distance from the equator.\\nThe right panel shows regional means conditional on controls for climate and distance from the equator.\\n4Environ.

Machine learning predictions\\nTable 2contains results from our out-of-sample predictive\\ntest, where we compare the performance of our preferredparametric prediction model (Model 4) and two competing\\nML algorithms (the boosted decision tree and the bag decision\\ntree). The average sum of squared errors (SSE) and meanpercentage errors (MPE) for each model are summarized inthe table.The results indicate that both ML methods outperform\\nour preferred parametric predictive model by achieving\\nsmaller average out-of-sample SSE and MPE. The improved\\nability of ML models to predict out of sample suggests thatthey offer distinct advantages in modeling mangrove soilcarbon. Of the two ML methods, the bag DT performs betterthan the boosted DT, so we select it as our preferred ML\\nmodel.\\nCommunicating and further using ML model results can\\nbe challenging, as the model cannot be collapsed into anequation. However, in contrast to parametric models we cancalculate the relative importance of each predictor variable in\\nthe ML model (table 3) to gain insight into which predictors\\nexplain the greatest amount of variation in the data. We ﬁnd\\nthat annual precipitation is the most important predictor,followed by distance from the equator and geographic region.\\nPrecipitation seasonality, mean temperature of the coldest\\nquarter, and annual mean temperature explain less of thevariation in mangrove soil carbon.Table 1.

Res. Lett. 9(2014) 104013 S L Jardine and J V SiikamäkiUsing our ML predictive model along with mangrove\\nland cover data from Giri et al (2011 ), we construct a global\\ndataset (available online from the authors) of estimatedmangrove soil carbon concentrations (mg C cm\\n−3) and stocks\\n(Pg C) on a high-resolution grid (5 arc min). Standard errors\\nfor all of our estimates are calculated from the standarddeviation of predictions from 10 000 ML models constructedfrom 10 000 random samples (bootstrap samples) of our pri-mary soil carbon dataset. Figure 3maps the predicted soil\\ncarbon concentrations for the world ’s mangroves and ﬁgure 4\\nmaps mangrove soil carbon concentrations in Indonesia (andneighboring countries), a country that contains roughly 19.5%\\nof the world ’s mangroves. The ﬁgures illustrate considerable\\nspatial variation in mangrove soil carbon concentrations.\\nTo estimate global carbon stocks we assume a carbon-\\nrich soil depth of 1 meter, as common in the literature (e.g.Donato et al 2011 , Pendleton et al 2012 , Siikamäki\\net al 2012 ). Table 4lists the estimated global and country-\\nlevel stock for the top-20 countries. Globally, we estimate thatmangrove soils contain 5.00 ± 0.94 Pg C and that about 80.5%\\nof the pool is contained in 20 countries, which is roughly\\nproportional to the per cent of the world ’s mangroves these\\ncountries contain (81.3%).\\nOur results document considerable geographic variation\\nin soil carbon. We estimate that global mangrove soils contain369 ± 6.8 Mg C ha\\n−1on average (in the top meter). However,\\nwe estimate that the amount of carbon per hectare in theworld ’s most carbon-rich mangroves (the highest grid cell\\nprediction is 703 ± 38 Mg C ha\\n−1) is roughly 2.6 ± 0.14 times\\nthe amount of carbon per hectare in the world ’s most carbon-\\npoor mangroves (the lowest grid cell prediction is272 ± 49 Mg C ha\\n−1). We also ﬁnd substantial within-country\\nvariation in mangrove soil carbon. For example, in Indonesia,the country with globally the largest mangrove soil carbonstock, we estimate that the most carbon-rich mangrovescontain 1.5 ± 0.12 times as much carbon per hectare as the\\nmost carbon-poor mangroves.\\nWhen examining country averages, we ﬁnd that the\\ncountry with the highest average soil carbon concentrationhas roughly twice the amount of soil carbon, per hectare, asthe country with the lowest estimated soil carbon concentra-\\ntion. Interestingly, none of the top 20 countries, when rankedby soil carbon concentrations, overlap with the 20 countrieswith the largest carbon pools (table 4). In fact, the 20 coun-\\ntries with highest average soil carbon concentrations containonly 1.2% of the world ’s mangroves, but as a consequence of\\ntheir relatively high soil carbon, these countries account for\\n1.5% of global mangrove soil carbon.\\n4. Discussion\\nHere we develop a predictive model and global dataset of soil\\ncarbon concentrations, which documents and provides infor-\\nmation on the spatial distributio n of mangrove soil carbon. Our\\nresults indicate that the variation in soil carbon is systematicallydetermined by several climatic variables but that locationalvariables are also signi ﬁcant predictors of mangrove soil carbon.\\nSome of our results call for added discussion. First,\\nalthough Chmura et al (2003 )ﬁnd that soil carbon decreases\\nwith temperature, in our analysis, which includes and expandsbeyond the data in Chmura et al (2003 ), the (parametric)\\nresults show that, on average, carbon content increases with\\ntemperature, albeit at a decreasing rate. Our results are con-sistent with studies that ﬁnd mangrove productivity increases\\nwith temperature up to a threshold (Ellison 2003 , Field 1995 ).\\nSecond, our ﬁndings are consistent with several studies\\nthatﬁnd that extreme cold events have a signi ﬁcant impact on\\nmangrove productivity (Cavanaugh et al 2013 , Sneda-\\nker1995 , Woodroffe and Grindrod 1991 ). For example, our\\n(parametric) results show that a 1 degree C increase in tem-\\nperature during the coldest quarter leads to an increase of5.4 mg cm\\n−3of soil C, all else constant, or a 16.8% increase\\nrelative to the mean value of mangrove soil carbon con-centrations in our sample.\\nThird, we ﬁnd that ML algorithms perform substantially\\nbetter than simple parametric predictions in predicting out ofsample. Therefore, they may offer substantial gains in accu-\\nrately estimating mangrove soil carbon concentrations based\\non available data. On the other hand, the parametric model isexceedingly practical for predictions and, as such it offers auseful ﬁrst-order approximation.\\nFinally, to obtain the highest-quality predictive model\\ngiven available data, we explored several predictive modelingtechniques and compared their performance along severaldimensions. Nonetheless, as with any predictive model, the\\nquality of the predictions depends on the quality of the\\nunderlying data. For example, if the secondary observationsused in this analysis targeted sampling locations based oncharacteristics that are unobservable to us but correlated withsoil carbon concentrations (e.g. oversampling of pristinemangrove forests), then the underlying data would not berepresentative of the population and any predictive modelwould contain selection bias. The possibility that soil carbon\\nmeasurements oversample pristine mangrove locations is\\nspeculated about in Kristensen et al (2008 ) and Hutchinson\\net al (2013 ). Although there is no actual evidence of sampling\\nbias, it cannot be completely ruled out.Table 3. Predictor importance in the bag DT ML model. The\\nimportance score is calculated as the change in mean squared errordue to splits on each predictor and then dividing the sum by the\\nnumber of branch nodes.

We develop a modelto predict mangrove soil carbon, explaining substantial spatialvariation in the carbon concentrations of global mangrove\\nsoils. Our predictive model is based on a rich dataset ofmangrove soil carbon measurements, including over 900observations collected in 28 countries throughout the world,which represent the majority of global mangroves. Using\\nFigure 3. Global map of predicted mangrove soil carbon concentrations.\\nFigure 4. Map of predicted mangrove soil carbon concentrations for Indonesia (and neighboring countries).\\n7Environ. Res. Lett. 9(2014) 104013 S L Jardine and J V Siikamäkithe model predictions, we produce a high-resolution and\\nspatially explicit global dataset of mangrove soil carbon\\nconcentrations. These data can help examine current man-grove conservation projects and direct future mangrove con-\\nservation efforts, thus providing an important scienti ﬁc input\\nto mangrove conservation assessments.\\nBecause mangrove soil concentrations are determined by\\nclimate conditions, our predictive model can also help assess\\nthe impacts of a changing climate on carbon in mangrove soils,\\ni.e. our model can be used to predict changes in mangrove soilcarbon concentrations that result from changing climate con-\\nditions. This will allow for a more complete understanding of\\nthe impacts of climate change on mangroves.\\nMangrove carbon storage varies substantially over space;\\ntherefore, the bene ﬁts from mangrove conservation depend\\ncritically on the location of the mangroves conserved. In\\nprinciple, our results enable the targeting of mangrove con-servation to maximize bene ﬁts from avoided carbon emissions.\\nWe note, however, that a more meaningfully de ﬁned con-\\nservation strategy should consider the full range of bene ﬁts\\nfrom mangrove conservation, not only avoided carbon emis-\\nsions. Moreover, it is not clear ap r i o r i how similar or different\\na more multi-objective targeting strategy would be relative to a\\ncarbon-focused targeting. Although previous research (Sii-\\nkamäki et al 2012 ) suggests that, in general, carbon-focusedmangrove conservation will target areas that are also high in\\nbiodiversity, the relationship between carbon and biodiversitymay vary at a ﬁner spatial scale than has been considered thus\\nfar in the literature. Additionally, it is unclear whether the manyother bene ﬁts, such as shoreline protection or the provision of\\nnursery habitat for ﬁsh, from mangrove conservation are\\nstrongly and positively correlated with the potential for carbon\\noffsets in mangroves. Therefore, to develop a more compre-hensive understanding of mangrove conservation, future workis needed to evaluate the full array of ecosystem services thatmangroves provide. Our results can be an important input intothese future comprehensive assessments.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe thank Daniel Donato and Erik Kristensen for their\\nassistance with the data.

Introduction\\nMangroves are specially adapted plant groups that have a physiological, morpho-\\nlogical, or anatomical adaptation to survive and proliferate in saline tide washed soil\\nand mudﬂats. Mangroves are distributed across the globe in the tropical and subtropical\\ncoastlines, deltas, estuaries, and islands. Indonesia has the largest area under the man-\\ngrove cover scattered across the tropical islands, but the ‘Sundarban mangrove wetland’\\nshared by Bangladesh (60%) and India (40%), is the world’s largest contiguous mangrove\\nforest. This region is also the world’s largest delta with dense population, facing intense\\nanthropocentric developmental pressures.\\nExisting in the ecotone of terrestrial and marine ecosystems, mangroves are crucial\\nfor the survival and healthy functioning of both. Research has already established a\\nmultitude of ecological services rendered by these plant communities, namely, Ecosystem-\\nbased Disaster Risk Reduction (Eco-DRR), breeding ground of marine fauna, pollutant\\nsink, economic service in terms of forest products, consolidation of soil, and resilience\\nLife2023 ,13, 271. https://doi.org/10.3390/life13020271 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/lifeLife2023 ,13, 271 2 of 11\\nto tidal erosion [ 1–6]. Foremost amongst these services is their ability to sequester an\\nenormous amount of carbon in the soil. This sequestered soil carbon in the saline, edaphic\\nenvironment of mangrove and sea grasses is referred as ‘blue carbon’. Mangrove and sea\\ngrass constitutes the blue carbon sink, which is larger than most of the terrestrial ecosystems,\\nsuch as boreal forests and tropical forest types [ 7]. Blue carbon has been recognized as a\\nsolution to the global problem of climate change. Sundarban ecosystem is a repository of\\nthe sediment organic carbon content, varying between 0.92 to 3.29%, resulting in an organic\\ncarbon stock of 59.14 Tg within 90 cm of the intertidal sediment [6].\\nWith all the conservation efforts and global focus on conserving the mangrove ecosys-\\ntem, the footprint of human development has altered the land use and mangrove cover\\nacross the globe [ 8]. By then, 54 out of 102 islands at the Indian part of Sundarbans was un-\\nder human habitation and mangrove forests had been wiped out to facilitate developmental\\nactivities such as agriculture and aquaculture. The rest of the islands were conserved and\\nis the last remaining frontier for enigmatic mangrove forest dwelling Royal Bengal Tigers.\\nHowever, blue carbon stocks are reducing across the Sundarban mangrove ecosystem [ 6,9].\\nMangroves in an average can sequester of 1023 Mg C per hectare. Studies demonstrate that\\nSundarban’s mangrove ecosystem can sequester approximately 4.71–6.54 Mg C ha\\x001year\\x001\\nC [6,9]. However, land conversions and climate change impacts are destabilizing both\\necological functions and services at Indian Sundarbans. Research by Bera et al. revealed an\\napproximate 6,313,944 mg/6.31 Tg loss of C at Sundarbans between 1975 and 2020 [9].\\nThe recent decade has observed a shift in international perception towards climate change\\nand global warming. The frequency and number of tropical disturbances had also increased\\nover the years due to the impact of climate change, periodically inundating human-colonized\\nislands of Indian Sundarbans. Restoration initiatives have also increased in these islands to\\nprotect the mudflats and embankments from erosion during natural disasters [ 5]. Blue carbon\\nsequestration is the key tool in the hand of climate change ecologists against the fight with\\nclimate change. Restoration initiatives are known to improve the blue carbon pool [3].\\nThis article focuses on a research question: ‘Does multispecies mangrove plantation\\nhelp in improving blue carbon sequestration in comparison to natural mangrove patches\\nunder anthropogenic pressure?’. The rationale of the study is to compare the soil carbon\\npool between different mangrove metapopulations (with varied community composition)\\nto a mixed mangrove plantation.\\nTo answer this question, our lab group investigated the biodiversity and blue carbon\\npool along with associated soil ecological function indicators between five sites with different\\nmangrove community composition, of which one site is a 4-year-old mixed species plantation.\\n2. Materials and Methods\\n2.1. Study Site\\nThe study area has been selected at different parts of Indian Sundarbans with different\\nforest/plantation, as natural mangrove community sites.

Plantation, Monitoring and Assessment Strategy\\nSite-1: Rhizophora mucronata have been planted through the drain and trench method to\\nmaximize the survival of the nursery grown saplings [ 3]. Before the R. mucronata plantation\\nsite, there was a natural cover of Avicennia marina plants.

Hence, there has been a need for a yearly biodiversity\\nassessment in the area.

Soil Sampling and Analyses\\nSoil sampling was conducted in the sites during 2016. An acid washed trowel was\\nused to scoop out the soil from upper surface of the mudﬂat (0–30 cm). The sample was\\ncollected in three replicate subsamples for each ﬁve sites, which were further mixed and\\nhomogenized to prepare a composite soil sample. The sites were selected, keeping in mind\\nthe similarity of anthropogenic stresses at all sites (to negate the biasness of the data) and\\nto cover maximum types of mangrove community composition found at human-inhabited\\nparts of the Indian Sundarbans. In the plantation sites, soil samples were collected from\\nthe four corners of ten 5 m \\x025 m quadrat, of which three were from areas with A. marina\\ndominance and seven from areas with R. mucronata dominance, and all the soil samples\\nare mixed. Approximately 30% of the area was under the cover of A. marina , while the rest\\nof the 70% was under the R. mucronata plantation, though there was intermixing at most\\nof the sampled spaces. The collected soil samples were placed in plastic bags and labeled\\nbefore being brought to the laboratory.\\nSoil organic carbon (SOC) was determined through the wet digestion method and\\nreported as a percentage [ 11,12]. While preparing the reagents for analysis of SOC, 5 gLife2023 ,13, 271 5 of 11\\nAg2SO4/L of H 2SO4is added before the use of H 2SO4to minimize the interference of Cl-in\\nthe saline mangrove soil [ 3]. Bulk density was calculated through the standard method [ 12].\\nSoil pH was measured by a multiparameter pH probe (HI-2020, Hanna Instruments,\\nIndia) by making a suspension with deionized water (1:2.5, w/v) and after allowing it to\\nsettle for one hour [ 12]. Plant-available nitrogen (N) was estimated after digesting the\\nsamples with 0.32% KMnO 4solution followed by titration with 0.02 N H 2SO4using the\\nKjeldahl distillation unit (KJELODIST-EAS VA, Pelican Equipment Inc., Chennai, India) [ 13].\\nPlant available Phosphorus was determined by the Olsen method [14].\\nCarbon pool (0–10 cm) was calculated using SOC concentration, bulk density, and\\nparticular soil depth [15], as follows:\\nCarbon pool (Mg C ha\\x001) = SOC \\x02BD\\x02T\\nwhere SOC = Soil Organic carbon (%); BD = bulk density (g cm\\x003), and T = soil thickness (cm).\\n2.4. Assessing the Health of the Ecosystem\\n‘Community ecology’ has two estimators that indirectly shed light onto the overall\\nhealth of the ecosystem. The ﬁrst one is a ‘Dominance’ estimator that focuses on overall\\ndominance of one or group of species representing \\x0b-diversity of the ecosystem. The\\nreciprocal of the dominance estimator is the ‘Diversity’ value. However, these estimators\\nare generally biased to the most dominant species in an ecosystem. Hence, information-\\nstatistic indices are used to quantify the ‘entropy’ or ‘randomness’ in a community, which\\nshed light onto the overall health of an ecosystem.\\nFor understanding dominance, ‘Simpson’s Index of Dominance (D)’ is used, which\\nis [16,17],\\nD=Sn(n\\x001)\\nN(N\\x001)\\nSimpson’s Index of Diversity (L) is [16,17],\\nL=1\\x00D\\nShannon Diversity Index (H) shed light into the overall diversity and health of the\\necosystem, depicted as [18],\\nH=\\x00SpiLn pi\\nIn the equations, D = Simpson’s Index of dominance, L = Simpson’s Index of Diversity,\\nH’ = Shannon’s Index, n = Number of individuals of each species, N = Total number of\\nindividuals of all the species, and pi = Total number of individuals in each species/Total\\nnumber of individuals in all the species [18].\\n2.5. Statistical Tests\\nStatistical treatment was applied in Microsoft Excel 2007 and SPSS 16 (SPSS Inc.\\nChicago, IL, USA). The regression analysis was used to understand the trends in temporal\\nchanges in salinity regime and biodiversity. The standard error is used to understand the\\nreliability of the data. The variance of mean (n = 3) has been evaluated by the Analysis of\\nVariance (one-way ANOVA), followed by Duncan’s post hoc test after testing the dataset\\nfor the application of these statistics using the Shapiro–Wilk’s and Levene’s test.\\n3. Results\\n3.1. Biodiversity and Ecological Health Assessment\\nBlue carbon has been referred to as one of the key ecosystem services of mangroves,\\nand scientists across the globe has been trying ﬁnd out the relationship between the seques-\\ntration and drivers that inﬂuence the rate of C-trapping in the soil [ 19].

Discussion\\n4.1. Biodiversity and Ecological Health\\nIt is evident from Table 2 that the Plantation location (Site 1 or S1) has a 24 RD value\\nforA. marina , while it has an RD of 60 for R. mucronata (planted species). This species\\nassociation is due to the mixed plantation model with naturally existing A. marina trees in\\nthe Low Tide Level, to reduce the wave impact during the tides. This resulted in luxuriant\\ngrowth of R. mucronata . The mangrove associate A. ilicifolius was only nominally present in\\nthe site.\\nSite-2 (S2) has an 80 RD value for A. marina , indicating its dominance in the natural\\nmetapopulation. The rest of the species are rarely present in the site. Site-3 has a 48 RD for\\nA. marina, while S. caseolaris is recorded to be at 16. A. ilicifolius have a RD of 24, but it is a\\nsmall thorny herb and a mangrove associate (semelparous species), while both A. marina\\nand S. caseolaris are trees with an iteroparous life cycle pattern. The Semelparous species\\nshows a life strategy where the plants (generally herbs) grow for a short duration (seasonal\\nor annual), and invests maximum energetics in the reproductive cycle and propagation.\\nThe short life cycle makes it difﬁcult for semelparous species to impart any changes in\\nthe microenvironment where they grow. Iteroparous species can live longer and obtain\\nreproductive maturity at a latter part of life but can modify the microenvironment, making\\nit suitable for growth. Mostly tree species follow an iteroparous life cycle.\\nSite-3 (S3) has an association of two iteroparous tree species: A. marina (RD = 55) and\\nS. caseolaris (RD = 21). Though the semelparous mangrove associate and grass P . coarctata\\nhave a RD value of around 13, it minimally impacts the microenvironment of the habitat.\\nSite-4 (S4) has a dominance of the edaphic sub-climax species and mangrove palm\\nand shrub, P . paludosa (RD = 63). The rest of the species have a sparce distribution. It does\\nindicate a greater erosional impact in the study site, as focused on previous studies [ 22].\\nThese shrublands provide little protection against the tidal current or wave action during\\nstorm surges, making the shorelines vulnerable to erosional dynamics, unlike iteroparous\\nmangrove trees such as A. marina ,R. mucronata ,C. tagal orS. caseolaris , which impart\\necosystem services such as the consolidation of soil, barrier against natural disaster, and\\nprotection from erosion [5].\\nSite-5 (S5) has a a dominance of only a salt tolerant ruderal semelparous herb- S.\\nmaritima (RD = 69). The rest of the species has been sparsely distributed in the study\\nsite. This species has been demonstrated to be highly adapted to soil salinity and oxy-\\ngenation stress [ 23]. They are generally observed in the sites under salinity stress with\\nlow biodiversity. It creates a mat in the soil, making it difﬁcult for propagules of other\\nspecies to lodge and grow in the sites. Being a semelparous ruderal, it rarely inﬂuences the\\nmicro-environment of the study site.\\nThe theory of island biogeography suggests that the distance from the nearest large\\npopulation pool determines the distribution of species [ 24]. However, in the case of\\nSundarbans, this theory may not be justiﬁed. In the current study, it has been observed\\nthat the distance from the nearby conserved larger metapopulation does not determine the\\nspecies distribution of mangroves (Table 1).\\nThis spatial study indicates that the distance from the nearest conserved mangrove\\npopulation and observed species number at the sites indicates that geological forcing of en-\\nvironmental parameters may be more important for the species distribution of mangroves,\\ncontrary to the island biogeography theory. Though data from only ﬁve sites do not conclu-\\nsively disprove the island biogeography theory at Indian Sundarbans and that geological,\\nclimate change, ecological forcing have been more prominent drivers for shaping the man-\\ngrove community ecology, but it does substantiate further investigation on understanding\\nthe ecosystem of Sundarbans through the lens of ‘Island biogeography’ theory.\\nThe plantation site (Site-1) shows a higher diversity and lower dominance value, indi-\\ncating a restoration of the ecosystem with different species colonizing the sites apart from\\nthe planted species- R. mucronata . The Shannon-Weiner Index shows a higher comparative\\nvalue compared to other natural sites except Site-3. Amongst all the sites, Site-3 with aLife2023 ,13, 271 8 of 11\\nnatural assemblage of A. marina and S. caseolaris had the robust ecosystem health and lesser\\nrandomness or ‘entropy’ in the ecosystem. The Diversity value is also the highest amongst\\nother sites, which is reciprocal to the dominance. The sites (4 and 5) under erosional or\\nsalt stress and with only dominant semelparous herbs, had the lowest diversity value and\\nhighest randomness or entropy amongst all the \\x0b-diversity habitats. This concludes that\\nboth the sites are under stress, with a local extinction of most of the key mangrove species\\nfound in the Sundarban mangrove community ecology such as B. sexangula ,C. tagal ,R.\\nmucronata ,S. caseolaris . The Shannon-Weiner Index value ideally ranges between 1.5 to\\n3.5. This value of Shannon-Weiner for all the sites is below, 1.5, which indicates increased\\nanthropogenic stress on all the sites. The selection of study site is based on the mudﬂats\\nnear to human habitation; hence, anthropogenic stresses were essential drivers in shaping\\nthe community ecology of all the sites.\\n4.2. Comparing the Ecosystem Function and Services\\nTable 4 indicates the major indicators of ecosystem services such as pH, soil salinity,\\nOC, BD, N, P and soil texture. The ecosystem function and services can be quantiﬁed\\nthrough these soil indicators [ 25,26]. S1 have the highest proportion of clay, while S3 have\\nmore silt and S4 have the highest sand proportion amongst all the sites. The pH of all\\nthe sites varied signiﬁcantly and was recorded within the alkaline range. The pH of the\\nsoil in S4 and S5 is highly alkaline, and the same sites also have the high soil salinity in\\ncomparison with the other sites. The pH of hypersaline mangrove wetlands always tends\\nto be alkaline due to the presence of basic ions of Na, K, Ca and Mg. The high salinity\\nand pH in S4, S5 indicates the formation of ‘saline blanks’ on the surface of the soil. This\\noccurs when a particular soil has been devoid of biodiversity cover, and that results in the\\ntransport and deposition of salt from lower depths of soil through capillary action due to\\nevaporation. Both S4 and S5 has been observed to have saline blanks; although, in the case\\nof S5, around 20% of the surveyed land is impacted due to the saline blank formation. High\\nsalinity and pH hinder the growth and colonization of natural mangrove species; hence,\\nboth the sites have a dominance of only salt tolerant or stress tolerant semelparous species,\\ninstead of a healthy mangrove community composition. This has been evident from the\\nShannon-Weiner Index and Simpson’s Index of Diversity.\\nSoil organic carbon is highest in the S1, due to the association between two key\\nmangrove species. The ecosystem has been restored, which is evident from the mixed\\nspecies composition and colonization trend of non-planted mangroves and halophytes. S2,\\nwhich have a dominance of the salt tolerant mangrove, A. marina , also recorded a high\\nSOC compared to other sites. A. marina grows fast and has been known to tolerate high\\nsalinity stress, and is hence ideal for proliferation at Sundarban mudﬂats [ 10,27]. The other\\necosystem function parameters such as N and P have also been recorded higher in S1, S2\\nand S3 compared to the other. All of these sites have a dominance of species, which are\\niteroparous mangroves; hence, the leaf litter is accumulated and transported to soil daily.\\nAll mangroves are evergreen plants that shed leaves throughout the year, unlike deciduous\\nplants. The litter constitutes for increased nutrient-N,P in the soil. When compared between\\nall ﬁve metapopulations considered in this study, the highest N is recorded in S3 because\\nof the association between two mangrove tree species— A. marina and S. caseolaris . Previous\\nstudies have demonstrated that the S. caseolaris leaf has an N content that inﬂuences the\\nnutrient dynamics of the soil where it grows [ 28]. The association of the two species and\\ncolonization of the other mangrove species indicates an approximately better ecological\\nhealth, but a Shannon-Weiner value less than 1.5 for all the sites does indicate a stressed\\necosystem that is in need of conservation interventions.\\nThe blue carbon pool was found to be highest in the plantation site (S1), followed by\\nS2 with more than 10–15-year-old A. marina strands (Figure 3).Life2023 ,13, 271 9 of 11\\nLife 2023 , 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 11 \\n \\n S2, which have a dominance of the salt tolerant mangrove, A. marina,  also recorded a high \\nSOC compared to other sites.

This is the first study\\nto apply a globally consistent and automated method for mapping mangroves, identifying a global\\nextent of 137,600 km2. The overall accuracy for mangrove extent was 94.0% with a 99% likelihood that\\nthe true value is between 93.6–94.5%, using 53,878 accuracy points across 20 sites distributed globally.\\nUsing the geographic regions of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, Asia has the highest proportion\\nof mangroves with 38.7% of the global total, while Latin America and the Caribbean have 20.3%,\\nAfrica has 20.0%, Oceania has 11.9%, North America has 8.4% and the European Overseas Territories\\nhave 0.7%. The methodology developed is primarily based on the classification of ALOS PALSAR\\nand Landsat sensor data, where a habitat mask was first generated, within which the classification\\nof mangrove was undertaken using the Extremely Randomized Trees classifier. This new globally\\nconsistent baseline will also form the basis of a mangrove monitoring system using JAXA JERS-1\\nSAR, ALOS PALSAR and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 radar data to assess mangrove change from 1996 to\\nthe present. However, when using the product, users should note that a minimum mapping unit\\nof 1 ha is recommended and that the error increases in regions of disturbance and where narrow\\nstrips or smaller fragmented areas of mangroves are present. Artefacts due to cloud cover and the\\nLandsat-7 SLC-off error are also present in some areas, particularly regions of West Africa due to the\\nlack of Landsat-5 data and persistence cloud cover.

Introduction\\nMangroves are forested wetlands that are uniquely adapted to the intertidal zone. Found in the\\ncoastal zones of more than 118 countries in the tropics, subtropics and temperate regions [1–3],\\nmangroves have (for centuries) provided natural resources to local populations, including food\\n(particularly fish and invertebrates) and timber. However, through processes such as population\\nincreases, industrialisation, urban expansion and globalisation, their extent has been reduced [ 4] and\\nmany have been fragmented or degraded [ 5], particularly in Southeast Asia, where about one third\\n(32%) of the world’s mangroves are located [ 6]. Many of the mangrove areas that have remained\\nrelatively intact are those that are remote, inaccessible, protected within conservation reserves or\\nreceive national protection, for example in Australia. Globally, mangroves are being increasingly\\naffected by climatic fluctuations, including those induced by human activities [ 5]. At the same\\ntime, mangroves are receiving greater recognition for their role in food provision, coastal protection\\n(e.g., from large storms), reserves of biodiversity [ 7] and as a large carbon store [ 8]. Hence, there are\\nnumerous and increasing efforts to ensure protection and restoration across their range. A fundamental\\nrequirement for mangrove protection and restoration is information about current and historical\\nmangrove distributions and conditions. While critical for informing efforts that support conservation,\\nsustainable management, and restoration of these ecosystems, data on mangrove status and extent\\nare necessary to meet reporting requirements for signatories to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands\\nand other countries with mangroves in their territories who are striving to meet the Sustainable\\nDevelopment Goals [5,9].\\nAt a global level, maps of mangrove extent have previously been generated by Spalding et al. for\\n1960–1996 [ 3] and 1999–2003 [ 2], by curating the best available national and regional maps, and by\\nthe United States Geological Survey (USGS; [ 1]) for 2000, based on the classification of Landsat sensor\\ndata primarily from 1997–2000. The FAO [ 4,10,11] have also conducted surveys to estimate global\\nextent for 1980, 1990 and 2000 and, in the later studies, both the FAO and Spalding et al. [2]referred\\nto the 2000 Giri et al. [1] to fill in gaps in coverage. The map of Giri et al. [1]has been regarded as the\\nmost globally consistent because of the standardised use of Landsat sensor data and methodology\\nwithin a defined period but, in some cases, the contribution of local to regionally-derived maps\\nto Spalding et al. [2] results in better mapping (depending on the scales and methods used). Hence,\\nwhilst the maps of mangrove area are broadly in agreement, many differences exist in terms of area\\nand boundary locations with these sometimes exaggerated by differences in accuracy in the geometric\\nlocation, scale and generalisation of the map products. The maps generated are also historical (currently\\nby at least two decades) and are unable to be easily updated and certainly not on a regular (e.g., annual)\\nbasis. Rates of mangrove loss can also then not be determined as the products from different years are\\nbased on different methods.\\nTo address the need for timely information on mangroves at a global level, the Japan Aerospace\\nExploration Agency (JAXA) Kyoto & Carbon (K&C) Initiative formulated the Global Mangrove Watch\\n(GMW), which aimed to produce consistent 25 m spatial resolution maps of mangrove extent across\\ntheir range by generating a baseline map for 2010. For mapping, Japanese L-band Synthetic Aperture\\nRadar (SAR) data were considered most appropriate given their global coverage and sensitivity\\nto the woody components of mangroves [ 12]. However, a limitation is that mangroves are often\\ndifficult to distinguish from other land covers (particularly forests and plantations) on the landward\\nmargins. For this reason, Landsat sensor data were integrated into the analysis to improve the baseline\\nmap. The mapping was also confined to locations with conditions considered suitable to support\\nmangroves. The objective of the GMW is to provide the information needed by a wide range of users,\\nincluding wetland and forest managers, civil society organisations, contracting partners of the Ramsar\\nConvention, and countries with mangroves in their territories.\\nMany studies have used Earth Observation (EO) data to map mangrove extent. At a global level,\\nthe study of Giri et al. [1]was the first, with this using an unsupervised classification approach and\\nmanual selection of classes associated with mangroves. Many studies have used the Giri et al. [1]Remote Sens. 2018,10, 1669 3 of 19\\nproduct as a basis for further analysis. For example, Hamilton and Casey [13]intersected the\\nGiri et al. [1] map with the forest cover change of Hansen et al. [14]to assess changes in mangrove\\nextent. Thomas et al. [6]was the first to consider L-band SAR for global assessment of mangrove\\nchange, which was assessed visually by on a 1\\x0e\\x021\\x0egrid overlain onto a composite of Japanese Earth\\nResources Satellite (JERS-1) SAR from 1996 and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS PALSAR)\\ndata from 2007 and 2010. Causes of change were also reviewed based on features including shape and\\ncontext. Other studies have been more focused on local sites, such as a single delta (e.g., the Mangoky\\nRiver delta, Madagascar [ 15], Mekong Delta, Vietnam [ 16]) or countries (e.g., Mozambique [ 17],\\nPhilippines’ [ 18], Kenya [ 19], and Mexico [ 20]). Methods adopted have varied. The majority have\\nused optical (primarily Landsat) datasets (e.g., [ 15,17–19]), while a few have fused optical and SAR\\ndata (e.g., [ 21,22]). In terms of analysis, a broad range of techniques have been used, including object\\norientated methods making use of image segmentation (e.g., [ 23]), rule based classifiers (e.g., [ 21]),\\nunsupervised classifiers (e.g., [ 17,18,24]) and machine learning methods (e.g., [ 22,23]). While there\\nis no clear dominant direction in terms of methodology for assessing mangrove extent, a significant\\ngap is the lack of studies that have sought to develop and apply a single consistent methodology that\\nis repeatable over large geographic areas, including at the global level. Therefore, this study aims to\\nprovide a new updated baseline of global mangrove extent, which can be used as a basis for studying\\nmangrove change and uses a single globally consistent methodology.\\n2. Methods\\nThe new global mangrove baseline has been generated using a combination of Synthetic Aperture\\nRadar (SAR) from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased-Array L-band Synthetic\\nAperture Radar (PALSAR) and optical satellite data from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and\\nLandsat-7 Enhanced TM (ETM+). The overall approach followed four stages: (a) extraction of a\\ncoastal water mask from the PALSAR data; (b) generation of a mangrove “habitat” layer that identified\\nareas that were actually or potentially able to support mangroves; (c) generation of an initial baseline\\nclassification using the PALSAR data only; and (d) refinement of the initial baseline classification using\\nLandsat sensor composites to improve the distinction of the landward border between mangroves and\\nother terrestrial land covers. A final quality assurance (QA) of the resulting baseline product was then\\nundertaken through visual assessment and, where appropriate, errors were corrected. An overview of\\nthe methods for producing the new mangrove baseline is shown in Figure 1.\\nUnless otherwise stated, all data processing was undertaken using the open source Remote\\nSensing and GIS Software Library (RSGISLib [ 25]), the KEA file format [ 26], the Scikit-Learn [ 27]\\nmachine learning library and scripted in python as outlined by Clewley et al. [28].\\n2.1. Datasets\\nUsing data acquired in 2010, a baseline map of mangrove extent was generated by integrating\\nALOS PALSAR and a composite of Landsat sensor data and referencing the 2000 Shuttle Radar\\nTopographic Mission (SRTM) 30 m Digital Elevation Model data and existing products delineating\\nshorelines, surface water occurrence and previous attempts to delineate global mangrove extents.\\nThese datasets are summarised in Table 1\\nFrom the global shoreline dataset, a global ocean regions dataset was derived to identify oceanic\\nwater bodies. The shoreline dataset was rasterised onto the same pixel grid as the ALOS PALSAR data\\nand oceanic water was defined as pixels that were 200 pixels ( \\x185000 m) from the defined shoreline.Remote Sens. 2018,10, 1669 4 of 19\\nMangrove BaselineCoastal MaskMangrove ‘Habitat’Mangrove Baseline (2010) #1Water OccurrenceBathymetryShoreline2010 PALSARExtremely Randomized Trees ClassiﬁcationDist.

For the SRTM data cubic spline interpolation was used, while for other continuous data\\n(e.g., Landsat) a cubic convolution was applied and for categorical data nearest neighbour interpolation\\nwas used.\\n2.1.1. ALOS PALSAR\\nThe ALOS PALSAR dual polarisation (HH+HV) backscatter data used were provided by JAXA\\nas1\\x0e\\x021\\x0emosaic tiles. The nominal spatial resolution was 25 m (0.8 arc seconds) and data were\\nprovided in the WGS84 (EPSG:4326) coordinate system. The mosaics are openly available in the public\\ndomain (http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/palsar_fnf/fnf_index.htm). The processing undertaken\\nto produce the tiled mosaics is detailed in Shimada et al. [33]. Global mosaics from JERS-1 SAR, ALOS\\nPALSAR and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 were available for 1996, annually from 2007 to 2010 and from 2015 to\\n2017. However, the 2010 mosaic was the most complete in terms of temporal consistency and spatial\\ncoverage and therefore was defined as the baseline (reference) year.\\n2.1.2. Landsat Composites\\nAlthough the ALOS PALSAR dual polarisation L-band SAR data provided a reasonable level\\nof discrimination of mangroves from other land cover types (particularly bare ground), there was\\nsome confusion with other wetland or forest types. This was particularly the case for certain\\ntypes of adjoining terrestrial forests and wetlands with similar structure to mangroves. However,\\nmangroves were distinct from many of these land covers within the Landsat sensor data, particularly inRemote Sens. 2018,10, 1669 5 of 19\\nthe near infrared and shortwave infrared wavelength regions. For this reason, composite images were\\ngenerated using Landsat sensor data acquired for 2010, although 2009 and 2011 images were also used,\\nwhere necessary, to provide sufficient imagery for the processing. In order to minimise the impact\\nof the Landsat 7 scan-line (SLC-off) error, which results in no-data striping in the imagery, Landsat 5\\ndata were primarily selected when available. To identify the scenes to download for each Landsat\\nrow/path, the following sequence of rules were applied:\\n1. Identify 10 Landsat 5 scenes with less than 10% cloud cover from 2010.\\n2. If less than 10 scenes available, then add Landsat 7 scenes with less than 10% cloud cover\\nfrom 2010.\\n3. If less than 5 scenes, then add Landsat 5 and 7 scenes from 2010 with less than 50% cloud up to a\\nmaximum of 15 scenes.\\n4. If less than 5 scenes, then extend time range to 2009–2011 and repeat Steps 1–3.\\nA total of 15,346 top-of-atmosphere Landsat scenes from 1766 row/paths were downloaded\\nusing the Google Cloud API (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/public-datasets/landsat).\\nThe images where processed to surface reflectance, cloud masked and topographically corrected using\\nthe “Atmospheric and Radiometric Correction of Satellite Imagery” (ARCSI [ 34]) software. ARCSI\\nderives a scene based aerosol optical depth (AOD) value using a dark object subtraction (DOS [ 35])\\nwhere a numerical inversion of the 6S [ 36] atmospheric model is applied to derive an AOD value\\nbased on the Blue wavelength. The 30 m (1 arc-second) SRTM elevation model was used to construct a\\nlook-up table (LUT) for correction with respect to elevation, which was applied subsequently to the\\ninput image to derive standardised (i.e., topographically corrected) reflectance using the approach\\nof Shepherd and Dymond [37]. The FMASK [ 38,39] cloud masking algorithm was applied for removal\\nof cloud and cloud shadow.\\nTo allow fusion with the ALOS PALSAR data, the resulting Landsat data were re-sampled,\\nusing cubic convolution, to match the 0.8 arc-second pixel grid of the ALOS PALSAR data. A maximum\\nNDVI compositing [ 40,41] processing chain was then applied using RSGISLib [ 25] at a project level\\n(see Section 2.2) to generate a single Landsat composite image corresponding with the project region\\ndefined using the ALOS PALSAR data.\\n2.2. Project Region Definition\\nTo undertake the processing, 128 project regions were defined that grouped the 1\\x0e\\x021\\x0etiles\\nsuch that: (a) no continuous area of mangroves was split by a project border; (b) the mangroves\\nwithin a project were considered to be contained within a similar bio-geographic region and (c) the\\ncomputational requirements of processing the projects were appropriate (i.e., balancing speed of\\nprocessing with available computing resource).\\nThe projects were defined by the union of Giri et al. [1]and Spalding et al. [2]datasets, where each\\nwere buffered by 0.1\\x0eand touching or overlapping polygons merged. The resulting polygons where\\nclustered using the approach outlined in Bunting et al. [42]where the minimum spanning tree was\\ncreated and edges with a length >0.5\\x0eor greater than 1 standard deviation of the edge lengths in\\nthe tree removed creating individual clusters. The resulting groups where then assessed, with small\\nregions merged into larger regions and large regions split when these were deemed too large for\\nefficient computational processing. This resulted in 131 project regions globally, although, for three,\\nthere were no ALOS PALSAR data and so they were excluded. The resulting 128 projects where\\nintersected with the 1\\x0e\\x021\\x0etile grid and grouped into 12 geographic regions (Figure 2) to create a\\nhierarchical numbering system.Remote Sens. 2018,10, 1669 6 of 19\\nFigure 2. GMW project regions: ( A) the 12 top level regions; and ( B) an example of the individual\\nprojects for the South American region.\\n2.3. Coastal Mask\\nMangroves are found within a coastal environment and therefore a key component of defining the\\nmangrove habitat mask was to define a coastal water mask. To achieve this, a water mask was defined\\nusing a per-pixel Extremely Randomized Trees classification using Scikit-Learn [ 27] and RSGISLib [ 25]\\nsoftware. The number of estimators for the Extremely Randomized Trees classifier was defined as 500\\nfollowing a grid search sensitivity analysis. The classification was performed using the ALOS PALSAR\\nHH and HV polarisations, the ratio of HH/HV, local incident angle and acquisition date.\\nThe key step in defining the coastal water mask was to define the training samples and regions\\nto be classified, which was performed automatically. An initial water mask was produced using a\\nthreshold of > 20water occurrences, and this was subsequently intersected with the oceanic region\\n(Section 2.1) to identify oceanic water. A coastal region was then defined as the area 20 pixels ( \\x18500 m)\\neither side of the shoreline with a bathymetry depth of > \\x00100m. Additional regions based on 80 pixels\\n(\\x182000 m) either side of the shoreline and a water occurrence < 80were added to this mask, with this\\nthen defining the region to be classified. 100,000 training pixels were then extracted randomly for land\\nand water from regions between > 20(\\x18500 m) and < 80(\\x182000 m) pixels away from the shoreline,\\nwith this defined as water or land using the water mask retrieved from the water occurrence layer.\\nFollowing the classification, a refinement was performed to remove small features, which required\\nclumping the classification to identify connected regions of a single class. Clumps classified as\\nland with an area of < 20pixels ( \\x1812,500 m2) and > 20water occurrence observations were assigned\\nto the water class, while water regions with an area of < 50pixels ( \\x1831,250 m2) were assigned to\\nland. These thresholds were identified through a sensitivity analysis and by visually assessing the\\nresulting maps.Remote Sens. 2018,10, 1669 7 of 19\\nThe thresholds used for generating the coastal mask were identified through an iterative sensitivity\\nanalysis based on a visual inspection of the resulting maps for a number of projects and sites globally\\nrepresenting a range of mangrove habitats.\\n2.4. Mangrove Habitat\\nMangroves exist within a specific ecological niche, which can be used to eliminate much of the area\\nwhere they will not be found. To define the region to be classified, and from which the non-mangrove\\npixels were selected, the following rules were defined, applied on a per-project basis. First, the SRTM\\nelevation needed to be less than 110% of the 99th percentile of the elevation of mangrove pixels. If the\\nresulting threshold was less than 5 m the threshold was set to 30 m, remembering that the SRTM is a\\nsurface model and therefore includes a component of vegetation height. The second rule, defined that\\nthe distance from the coastal water mask needed to be less than 110% of the 99th percentile of the\\ndistance of the mangrove pixels.\\nWithin the region defined above, a classification was subsequently performed. In total, 100,000\\nmangrove training pixels were randomly extracted from a union of the existing global mangrove\\nmaps from Giri et al. [1] and Spalding et al. [2], while 100,000 non-mangrove training samples were\\nrandomly extracted from within the region but outside of the mangrove union. If less than 100,000\\nmangrove pixels were available, then the number of samples selected for both classes was equal to the\\nnumber of mangrove pixels within the project.\\nThe classification was performed using the Extremely Randomized Trees classifier,\\nwith 100 estimators, defined through the use of a grid search sensitivity analysis of classifier\\nparameters. The input variables to the classification were: (a) pixel longitude and latitude; (b) distance\\nto water (defined using the coastal mask); (c) surface elevation defined by the SRTM; (d) distance to\\nthe oceanic layer; and (e) distances to the mangrove extents of Giri et al. [1]and Spalding et al. [2].\\nThe resulting habitat mask was visually checked and missing regions, including those that were not\\nidentified in the Giri et al. [1] and Spalding et al. [2] products, were added manually.\\nThe mangrove habitat layer (to be available at http://www.globalmangrovewatch.org) defines\\nthe maximum possible extent of mangrove habitat and therefore would not be needed to re-calculated\\nfor any subsequent mangrove mapping efforts.\\n2.5. Baseline Classification\\nThe new baseline was classified in two independent steps: first using the ALOS PALSAR and then\\nthe Landsat data. The ALOS PALSAR data were geographically contained entirely within the projects,\\nwhich allowed complete classification, but there were occasional gaps in the coverage of the Landsat\\nsensor data primarily because of cloud cover. In these gaps, the classification was based solely on the\\nALOS PALSAR data.\\n2.5.1. Classification: ALOS PALSAR\\nThe classification was undertaken using the Extremely Randomized Trees classifier, based on\\n100 estimators that were also defined through a grid search sensitivity analysis. The input variables\\nwere ALOS PALSAR HH and HV data (transformed to log unit dB), the ratio of HH/HV, pixel longitude\\nand latitude and the mangrove probability. Mangrove probability was defined using the union of\\nmangrove extent and generating a multi-dimensional histogram for the HH, HV and HH/HV data for\\nmangroves (defined using Giri et al. [1]) with a bin width of 0.25. The histogram was converted to a\\nprobability distribution function, which was used to calculate a probability of mangroves occurring in\\neach pixel.\\nTraining samples where defined through random sampling where 100,000 mangrove and\\nnon-mangrove samples were taken, resulting in 200,000 in total per project. For mangrove, 20,000\\nsamples were extracted from the intersection of the Giri et al. [1]and Spalding et al. [2]products and\\nthe remaining 80,000 were taken from the union of the two products. The non-mangrove samples wereRemote Sens. 2018,10, 1669 8 of 19\\nalso split, with 20,000 from within the habitat mask and 80,000 outside. The region outside the habitat\\nmask, within which training samples were selected, was defined as < 150pixels ( \\x183750 m) from the\\nunion of the mangrove products over areas of water and < 250pixels ( \\x186250 m) over terrestrial areas.\\nThe training points were visually checked and edited with reference to Google Earth Imagery as well\\nas the ALOS PALSAR and Landsat sensor imagery. In total, 20 M training points were defined globally\\nacross the 128 projects.\\n2.5.2. Classification: Landsat\\nUsing only a classification of ALOS PALSAR data, a consistent over-classification of the area of\\nmangroves was observed with this attributed to similarities in the structure and moisture content\\nof wetlands and forest cover types (indicated earlier). Therefore, a further refinement using optical\\nimagery was deemed necessary. The second classification iteration used the same training samples\\nas the ALOS PALSAR classification but samples without valid Landsat sensor data were removed.\\nUsing the Blue, Green, Red, Near-Infrared (NIR), Shortwave Infrared 1 (SWIR1) and SWIR2 spectral\\nbands, the Extremely Randomized Trees classifier, again using 100 estimators identified through a\\nsensitivity analysis, was applied to generate the final classification.\\n2.6. Merging into a Global Product\\nThe resulting project based analysis was compiled into a single global product for 2010 on a\\n1\\x0e\\x021\\x0etile basis. A few project regions shared individual tiles and these needed to be merged,\\nwhich was undertaken using a union operation.\\n2.7. Quality Assurance\\nFollowing the automated analysis, an extensive quality assurance (QA) process was undertaken.\\nDuring this process, the product was visually checked against the ALOS PALSAR and Landsat sensor\\ndata as well as contemporary (2010) Google Earth imagery. Where significant errors of omission and\\ncommission were identified, polygons were drawn and edits applied.\\n2.8. Accuracy Assessment\\nTo assess the overall accuracy of the product, a point-based accuracy assessment was undertaken.\\nFor the accuracy assessment, a stratified random sample was undertaken within each project using the\\nwater, mangrove and terrestrial non-mangrove classes, within a 50 pixels ( \\x181250 m) buffer from the\\nmangrove regions and within the mangrove habitat region. The number of accuracy samples, for each\\nclass, was 0.5% of the number of mangrove pixels, unless the resulting number of samples was less\\nthan 1000 in which case a 1% sample was taken.\\nWithin the projects, sites were selected (Figure 3 and Table 2) based on available local knowledge\\nand in some cases high resolution data. The accuracy assessment was undertaken using a custom\\nQGIS plugin that guides the operator to each point, providing a simple interface to decide between\\nclasses. The imagery used for reference included high resolution Google Earth imagery, custom high\\nresolution imagery, GMW Landsat image composites and ALOS PALSAR 2010 data.\\nTable 2.

[2]datasets both represent a period of around 2000 while the\\nGMW product is for 2010 so some differences in area were expected. Although the global total\\nestimates of the 2010 GMW v2.0 baseline and the 2000 Giri et al. [1]datasets are very close (137,600Remote Sens. 2018,10, 1669 12 of 19\\nversus 137,760 km2), significant differences (>10%) between the datasets can be observed at a regional\\nlevel that are unlikely to be attributed to actual changes. These differences are, in part, due to errors\\nand missing regions in the products (e.g., Figure 7).\\n-0.50-0.75103.25103.25\\n103.50103.50\\n103.75103.75\\n103.25103.25\\n103.50103.50\\n103.75103.75\\n-0.50-0.75103.25103.25\\n103.50103.50\\n103.75103.75ABC\\nFigure 7.

Background maps: Open\\nStreet Map (https://www.openstreetmap.org).\\nVisually, there is often a high degree of similarity between the products (see, for example, Figure 8).\\nHowever, numerical comparison of the Giri et al. [1]and Spalding et al. [2]products demonstrated\\nsignificant differences between these two products where, for instance, the global estimates of\\nmangrove extent equate to 137,760 km2versus 152,361 km2, respectively. The corresponding FAO [11]\\nestimates for 2000 and 2005 are 157,400 km2and 152,310 km2, respectively. This highlights a\\nsignificant uncertainty in our knowledge of global mangrove extent. Through a visual comparison, it\\nis considered that Spalding et al. [2]often overestimates the overall mangrove extent (e.g., Figure 9),\\nalthough there are also regions of missing data (e.g., Figure 7). At a regional scale, the errors\\nassociated with the Spalding et al. [2]dataset are relatively clear. For instance, the Spalding et al. [2]\\ndataset demonstrates that the region covering Latin America and the Caribbean accounts for 23.1%\\nof the World’s mangroves compared with 20.3% denoted by the GMW v2.0 baseline. Similarly,\\nthe Spalding et al. [2] dataset demonstrates that the Oceania region accounts for 7.7% of the world’s\\nmangroves, compared to 11.9% that is denoted in this study and in the Giri et al. [1] dataset.\\nTable 6. Mangrove extent comparison for the six Ramsar regions between the GMW v2.0 baseline,\\nGiri et al. [1] (v1.3; released 2015) and Spalding et al. [2](v2.0; released 2017). Figures for the latter\\ntwo were calculated from datasets downloaded from the UN Ocean Data Viewer (http://data.unep-\\nwcmc.org), and thus differ marginally from figures published by Giri et al. [1]and Spalding et al. [2]\\n(in brackets). It should be recognised that the comparison between these products should not be used\\nto infer changes in mangrove extent, as the differences rather can be considered to be predominately\\ndue to the mapping methodology and accuracy.\\nRegionGMW v2.0 (km2)\\n2010Giri et al.

Methods of Mapping Mangroves\\nOur results have yielded an updated global mangrove baseline, with an accuracy in excess of 90%.\\nThis new global baseline represents an improvement on existing global maps (e.g., Giri et al. [1]) for\\nmany regions across the world. This includes the successful mapping of mangroves for areas that were\\nfound to be absent in other existing products (e.g., Figure 7). The method made use of the existing\\nGiri et al. [1] and Spalding et al. [2]datasets to automatically generate classifier training samples that\\nwere subsequently visually checked. This approach produced a new mangrove extent yielding a total\\narea approximately equal to that of Giri et al. [1], while displaying significant regional variations. It\\nshould be noted that, due to the methodological differences in the generation of the GMW, Giri et al. [1]\\nand Spalding et al. [2]datasets, they cannot be used to infer indications of changes between their\\nrespective baseline years. The majority of mangrove area can be found in Asia, as identified by Giri\\net al. [1], with an approximately equal proportion distributed between Africa and Latin America and\\nthe Caribbean.\\nThis mangrove baseline was derived using publicly open imagery from the ALOS PALSAR and\\nLandsat sensors. These sensors are complimentary and were used in combination to achieve theRemote Sens. 2018,10, 1669 14 of 19\\nupdated baseline. The radar and optical imagery measure different properties of the forest and\\nwere used together to attain the baseline with high accuracy. The optical data is sensitive to the\\nbio-chemical (e.g., photosynthesis) properties of the forest and the radar is sensitive to the physical\\n(e.g., woody biomass) of the forest. In combination, these provide a more complete description of the\\nforest than from one dataset alone. The ALOS PALSAR data have the advantages of being cloud-free\\nand therefore each path is a consistent date rather than composited from a number of dates as with the\\nLandsat sensor data. This study also benefited from the availability of a number of additional global\\ndatasets, such as the water occurrence dataset [ 29] and shorelines [ 30,31], bathymetry [ 32] and the\\nSRTM elevation model.\\nThe study has produced a new baseline of global mangrove extent for 2010. The date of the\\nbaseline was driven by the availability of the ALOS PALSAR data, which was most complete for\\n2010. However, the availability of Landsat data in 2010 is poor with Landsat 5 TM data not available\\nglobally, with particular sparsity of data throughout Africa. The Landsat 7 ETM+ suffered with the\\nSLC-off failure (Figure 10). Given the importance of the Landsat sensor data to the classification of\\nmangroves, future studies would be recommended to prioritise the availability of suitability optical\\ndata (i.e., Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2). Additionally, the increased spatial resolution (10 m) of Sentinel-2\\nis expected to improve the mapping of fine features (e.g., riverine, aquaculture and fine coastal fringes)\\nand disturbed areas where the error in the GMW v2.0 baseline are highest.\\nFigure 10. Douala, Cameroon: ( A) the Landsat Composite; and ( B) the Landsat composite with\\nthe GMW v2.0 baseline overlaid in green, illustrating an area with poor Landsat coverage due to\\ncloud cover, lack of Landsat-5 data and influence of the Landsat-7 SLC-off artefact. The 2010 Landsat\\ncomposite generated for this study is visualised using the NIR, SWIR and Red wavelength bands.\\nThe updated baseline is able to suit the requirements and needs of policy and decision makers.\\nThese data are aimed to support a wide range of international initiatives and users, including wetland\\nmanagers, government bodies, civil society users and Ramsar Convention contracting parties.\\nAn up-to-date baseline is of critical importance for the inclusion of mangroves in these and future\\ninitiatives, such as REDD+. However, while a baseline is highly useful, the measurement of change in\\nmangrove extent using a consistent global methodology would be a very significant further advance\\nand direction for future work.\\n4.2. Forming a Monitoring System\\nThis Global Mangrove Watch map represents the extent and distribution for 2010, but is also a\\nbaseline from which a monitoring system can be built (Figure 11). Thomas et al. [22]demonstrated a\\nnovel “map-to-image” method to update mangrove baselines using time-series radar imagery with aRemote Sens. 2018,10, 1669 15 of 19\\nhigh degree of accuracy. By focussing on the mapping of changes away from the baseline, the trend in\\nchange is more consistent than comparing independently classified baselines. The “map-to-image”\\nmethod is also directly applicable at the global level and can be used to iteratively derive baselines\\nback in time using historical data and into the future with the continued acquisition of current\\nsensors and anticipated launch of future satellites. Being derived from, and therefore spatially\\nregistered to the ALOS PALSAR data, this new GMW v2.0 baseline constitutes an ideal basis for\\nsuch a monitoring system using the Japanese JERS-1 SAR (ca. 1996), ALOS PALSAR (2007–2010)\\nand ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 (2015–present) imagery, enabling maps of mangrove extent to be generated\\nfor a number of epochs. Data availability is expected to continue and increase into the future with\\nanticipated data from ALOS-4 PALSAR-3, as well as other globally available and near-future datasets\\n(e.g., Sentinel-1, SAOCOM-1A/1B, NISAR and Tandem-L). The global mangrove baseline detailed\\nin this paper, in combination with the novel “map-to-image” change detection technique outlined\\nin Thomas et al. [22], can therefore be used to used to form an operational global mangrove monitoring\\nsystem for driving policy and informing management decisions.\\nFigure 11. A flowchart of the proposed monitoring system which could be built on the 2010 GMW v2.0\\nbaseline using the methodology of Thomas et al. [22].\\n4.3. Cautions and Caveats\\nThe minimum size of mangrove region that is considered to be reliably identifiable within\\nthe ALOS PALSAR and Landsat sensor data are those than occupy multiple pixels and therefore\\na recommended minimum mapping unit of 1 ha (i.e., 8 pixels) for reliable mapping was used and\\nis advocated. Errors associated with the minimum feature size are particularly evident in areas of\\ndisturbance, such as around aquaculture ponds (e.g., Figure 12) as well as in riverine mangroves that\\nform narrow shoreline fringes.\\nThe Landsat image composites include artefacts (e.g., Figure 10) as a result of persistent cloud\\ncover and the Landsat-7 SLC-off error. This has particularly effected areas in West Africa (e.g., Niger\\nDelta and Cameroon) where cloud cover is frequent and Landsat-5 data were not available for 2010.\\nFuture work should focus on determining an optimal year for the production of an optical image\\ncomposite. For instance, data quality and availability is likely to be greater in the years after Landsat-8\\nwas launched (2013). Similarly, the availability of Sentinel-2 imagery (particularly since 2017 with\\nthe launch of Sentinel-2B) is considered a significant opportunity for further improvements, with a\\nresolution of 10 m aiding the mapping of smaller fringing and fragmented mangroves and the increased\\ntemporal resolution improves the quality of cloud-free composites.\\nThere are also some areas where mangroves are known to have been omitted in this version (v2.0)\\nof the GMW dataset, due to satellite data unavailability, including: Andaman and Nicobar Islands\\n(India), Bermuda (UK), Europa Island (France), Fiji, east of Anti-meridian, Guam and Saipan (USA),\\nKiribati, Maldives, Peru (south of latitude S4) and Wallis and Futuna Islands (France). While these\\nare not significant in terms of mangrove extent globally, which is the focus of this paper, they will be\\nincluded in the release of future GMW datasets.Remote Sens. 2018,10, 1669 16 of 19\\nVersion September 8, 2018 submitted to Remote Sens. 16 of 19\\nFigure 12.

Research shows that mangrove conservation may be a low-cost means of reducing CO\\n2emissions. Accordingly, there is growing interest in developing\\nmarket mechanisms to credit mangrove conservation projects for associated CO 2emissions\\nreductions. These efforts depend on robust and readily applicable, but currently unavailable,localized estimates of soil carbon. Here, we use over 900 soil carbon measurements, collected in 28countries by 61 independent studies, to develop a global predictive model for mangrove soil\\ncarbon. Using climatological and locational data as predictors, we explore several predictive\\nmodeling alternatives, including machine-learning methods. With our predictive model, weconstruct a global dataset of estimated soil carbon concentrations and stocks on a high-resolutiongrid (5 arc min). We estimate that the global mangrove soil carbon stock is 5.00 ± 0.94 Pg C(assuming a 1 meter soil depth) and ﬁnd this stock is highly variable over space. The amount of\\ncarbon per hectare in the world ’s most carbon-rich mangroves (approximately 703 ± 38 Mg C ha\\n−1)\\nis roughly a 2.6 ± 0.14 times the amount of carbon per hectare in the world ’s most carbon-poor\\nmangroves (approximately 272 ± 49 Mg C ha−1). Considerable within country variation in\\nmangrove soil carbon also exists. In Indonesia, the country with the largest mangrove soil carbon\\nstock, we estimate that the most carbon-rich mangroves contain 1.5 ± 0.12 times as much carbonper hectare as the most carbon-poor mangroves. Our results can aid in evaluating bene ﬁts from\\nmangrove conservation and designing mangrove conservation policy. Additionally, the results canbe used to project changes in mangrove soil carbon stocks based on changing climatologicalpredictors, e.g. to assess the impacts of climate change on mangrove soil carbon stocks.\\nSOnline supplementary data available from stacks.iop.org/ERL/9/104013/mmedia\\nKeywords: mangroves, blue carbon, REDD, soil carbon, ecosystem services, predictive\\nmodeling\\n1. Introduction\\nMangroves have long been recognized for the broad range of\\necosystem services they provide, including serving as primarynursery habitat for many species of ﬁs h ,c r u s t a c e a n s ,b i r d s ,a n d\\nmarine mammals, and protecting coastal communities from\\ncoastal erosion and damage from storms and other natural\\nhazards (Mumby et al 2004 ,S p a l d i n g et al 2010 ,T w i l l e y\\net al 1996 , Shepard et al 2011 ). More recently, mangroves\\nhave also received attention for their capacity to store large\\nv o l u m e so fc a r b o n( D o n a t o et al 2011 , Pendleton et al 2012 ,\\nSiikamäki et al 2012 ) .F o re x a m p l e ,o na v e r a g e ,m a n g r o v e s\\ncontain three to four times the mass of carbon typically foundEnvironmental Research Letters\\nEnviron.

Much of this carbon storage, however, is at risk of\\nbeing lost, because mangroves are among the most threatedand rapidly vanishing ecosystems globally, with habitat lossrates similar or greater to those in tropical forests (UN Foodand Agricultural Organization 2007 ,V a l i e l a et al 2001 ).\\nRecent studies point to mangrove conservation as a\\npotentially low-cost option for reducing CO\\n2emissions\\n(Pendleton et al 2012 , Siikamäki et al 2012 ). For example,\\nSiikamäki et al (2012 )ﬁnd that in most mangrove areas of the\\nworld, protecting mangroves achieves emissions reductions ata lower cost than reducing emissions elsewhere in the econ-omy. Accordingly, there is growing interest in developing andimplementing market-based mechanisms such as carbon off-\\nsets, to credit mangrove conservation for associated emissions\\nreductions, using a framework similar to the REDD (reducedemissions from deforestation and degradation) programsdesigned to protect tropical forests. The purpose of theseprograms is to provide market incentives to reduce emissionsfrom deforestation by, for example, encouraging developingcountries to reduce deforestation in return for compensationfrom developed countries committed to emission reductions\\n(Angelsen 2008 , Kindermann et al 2008 ).\\nDesigning and evaluating market mechanisms for man-\\ngrove conservation requires several spatially explicit scienti ﬁc\\ninputs, including information on the mangrove area susceptibleto deforestation, carbon in mangrove biomass and soils, annualcarbon sequestration, the emissions pro ﬁles of mangroves\\nconverted to other uses, and the opportunity cost of protectingmangroves (Siikamäki et al 2013 ). A growing number of\\nresearchers have recognized the need for more and better sci-\\nence and are calling for continued research on the potential toinclude mangrove conservation in climate change policy (e.g.Mcleod et al2011 , Pendleton et al2012 , Siikamäki et al2013 ).\\nA key challenge in assessing the carbon bene ﬁts from\\nmangrove conservation is the lack of rigorous spatial estimatesof mangrove soil carbon stocks. Unlike other tropical forests,for which the bulk of carbon storage is in biomass, mangrove\\ncarbon is primarily stored in the soil. For example, Donato et al\\n(2011 ) estimate that soil carbon comprises 49 –98% of carbon\\nin mangrove forests. Siikamäki et al (2012 ) developed the ﬁrst\\nspatial estimates of global mangrove soil carbon, using countryand regional level mean estimates of soil carbon concentrationsderived from the literature. While this provides an importantﬁrst step, the estimates do not capture the ﬁne-scale variation in\\nmangrove soil carbon concentrations and, therefore, the ﬁne-\\nscale variation in potential bene ﬁts from mangrove conserva-\\ntion in different locations.\\nWe address this data gap by developing a predictive\\nmodel of mangrove soil carbon to estimate global mangrovesoil carbon concentrations (mg C cm\\n−3) and stocks (Pg C) on\\na high-resolution grid (5 arc min). Our predictive model isbased on soil carbon measurements compiled in the meta-analyses by Chmura et al (2003 ), Kristensen et al (2008 ), and\\nDonato et al (2011 ). These three studies combined include\\ndata from over 900 samples collected in 28 countries, whichcontain 64.4% of global mangroves. We explore severalprediction methods, including machine-learning algorithms,to assess the generalizability and predictive performance of\\nalternative model speci ﬁcations.\\nOurﬁndings contribute to the science needed to accurately\\nquantify the bene ﬁts from emissions reductions achieved with\\nmangrove conservation. Combining results from our predictivemodel with information on the spatial distribution of above-\\nground biomass (e.g. Hutchison et al 2013 ) enables improved\\nestimation of the magnitude and spatial distribution of man-grove carbon storage, thereby aiding the design and evaluationof mangrove conservation projects. Additionally, because weﬁnd that climatological factors are important predictors of\\nmangrove soil carbon concentrations, our predictive model canbe helpful in assessing the impacts of climate change onmangrove carbon storage.\\n2. Methods\\n2.1. Data\\nWe use mangrove soil carbon measurements from meta-\\nanalyses by Chmura et al (2003 ), Kristensen et al (2008 ), and\\nDonato et al (2011 ). Combining data from these sources, after\\nremoving observations where the study location is notdocumented, yields a total of 932 samples that were collectedin 28 countries by 61 independent studies. The locations ofthe soil carbon samples are shown in ﬁgure 1.\\nObservations included in Chmura et al (2003 ) and\\nDonato et al (2011 ) are measurements of the soil carbon bulk\\ndensity, while Kristensen et al (2008 ) record the per cent\\norganic carbon (POC) of each soil sample. To combine theobservations, we convert POC measurements into bulk den-sity measurements following Donato et al (2011 ) with the\\nestimated relationship:\\n=−poc 3.0443bd , (1)1.313\\nwhere poc is the per cent weight of organic carbon in the soiland bd is the soil bulk density measured in grams per cubic\\ncentimeter. We then use the soil bulk density to calculate the\\nsoil carbon content in g C per cubic centimeter.\\nWe combine the soil carbon dataset with information on\\nseveral predictor variables that explain the carbon con-centration in mangrove soils, including the distance of theobservation ’s sampling location from the equator (the abso-\\nlute value of latitude coordinates to a 0.1 of a degree), severalvariables describing climate conditions at the sampling loca-\\ntions, and regional indicators. The data are available in the\\nonline supplementary materials at stacks.iop.org/ERL/9/\\n104013/mmedia .\\nFor the majority of the soil carbon data (76% of the\\nobservations), source studies report precise locational data,i.e. latitude coordinates reported to the 0.1 of a degree, whichwe are able to use directly. In some instances (9% of theobservations), a group of soil carbon samples were taken from\\nneighboring sites and only the boundary latitude and long-\\nitude coordinates are provided. In these cases we use themean latitude coordinate value for each of the soil carbonestimates in that study. In studies where only imprecise\\n2Environ. Res. Lett. 9(2014) 104013 S L Jardine and J V Siikamäkilocational data were provided, but a detailed map of the\\nsample location was included (13% of the observations), wemanually obtain a more precise location. Finally, wherelocational data were reported in the meta-analysis but could\\nnot be veri ﬁed (e.g. unpublished data), we use the locational\\ndata reported in the meta-analysis (2% of the observations).The latitude data are used to calculate distance from the\\nequator, which has been linked to mangrove productivity\\n(Twilley et al 1992 ), and therefore may be an important\\npredictor of mangrove soil carbon, a hypothesis which we testin our analysis.\\nClimate variables are from the WorldClim Bioclim data\\n(Hijmans et al 2005 ). Of the 19 variables included in the\\nBioclim data, we use mean annual temperature (Bioclim 1),mean temperature in the coldest quarter (Bioclim 11), total\\nannual precipitation (Bioclim 12), and seasonality in pre-\\ncipitation (Bioclim 15). Our choice of climate variables ismotivated by a large body of literature linking mangroveproductivity with temperature and precipitation (Ellison 2003 ,\\nField 1995 , McKee 1993 ) and extreme cold events (Cava-\\nnaugh et al 2013 , Snedaker 1995 , Woodroffe and Grin-\\ndrod 1991 ), implying that these climate variables should be\\nincluded in our model.\\nFinally, we include regional indicators, where regions are\\ndeﬁned according to the ten biogeographic regions for man-\\ngroves developed by Spalding et al (2010 ) (see the SI for\\ncountries represented in the data from each region). Our\\ngeographic predictors (distance from the equator and regional\\nindicators) control for the impacts of unobserved factors onthe carbon concentration in mangrove soils, to the extent towhich the unobserved factors vary over space. For example,\\nmangrove soil carbon has been linked to allochthonous riv-\\nerine or marine material, allochthonous production of algae,and phytoplankton (Bouillon et al 2003 , Kennedy et al 2004 ,\\nMarchand et al 2003 ) and tidal forcing (Kristensen et al 2008 )\\namong other things, all of which are unobserved but likely\\nvary systematically over space. Additionally, becausemangrove species are more homogeneous within mangrove\\nbioregions (Spalding et al 2010 ), mangrove soil carbon\\nconcentrations may also be more homogeneous within man-grove bioregions, which we control for with regionalindicators.\\n2.2. Predictive models\\nWe develop two classes of statistical models to predict soilcarbon concentrations, including parametric predictive mod-els and models developed with machine learning algorithms.Constructing a robust predictive model requires balancing theability to explain the most variation in the data sample with\\nthe model ’s generalizability, i.e. its ability to predict out of\\nsample (Babyak 2004 ). We evaluate the alternatives models\\nalong these two dimensions.\\n2.3. Parametric prediction\\nWeﬁrst develop a parametric predictive model with regres-\\nsion analysis. Speci ﬁcally, we estimate the following model:\\nαθ β δ ϵ =+ + + + climate sc avlatitude region , (2)ii i i i\\nwhere sciis soil carbon content in sampling location i,\\navlatitudeiis the absolute value of latitude for location i\\n(distance from the equator), climateiis a vector containing all\\nBioclim variables for site iand a squared term for average\\nannual temperature based on evidence of a nonlinear rela-tionship between mangrove soil carbon and temperature (e.g.Gilman 2008), and\\nϵiis an assumed mean-zero normally\\ndistributed random error. We estimate several speci ﬁcations\\nof equation ( 2), where certain parameters or sets of parameters\\nare constrained to equal zero. The model is estimated usingordinary least squares (OLS).\\nWe compare the parametric predictive models based on\\nR-squared statistics, signaling in-sample predictive power,and the Akaike information criterion (AIC), indicating modelgeneralizability as it relates to model simplicity.\\nFigure 1. Locations of soil carbon concentration measurement data from the meta-analyses by Chmura et al (2003 ), Kristensen et al (2008 ),\\nand Donato et al (2011 ).\\n3Environ. Res. Lett. 9(2014) 104013 S L Jardine and J V Siikamäki2.4. Machine learning prediction\\nMachine-learning (ML) algorithms offer an alternative to\\nsingle-equation parametric predictive modeling. They involvesystematic computational learning in the model-buildingprocess, which improves the model ’s the predictive perfor-\\nmance and generalizability by minimizing over ﬁtting. The\\nML methods used here are also ﬂexible in modeling non-\\nlinearities and/or interactions between the predictors. MLalgorithms are especially useful in instances where the func-tional relationship between the outcome variable and thepredictors is unknown, as is the case with mangrove soilcarbon concentrations (Kristensen et al 2008 ). ML methods\\nhave a long history in the ﬁeld of medical biosciences\\n(Kononenko 2001 ) and are rapidly gaining ground in several\\nﬁelds ranging from economics (Varian 2013 ), to conservation\\nbiology and ecology (Gomes 2009 , Dietterich 2009 ).\\nWe examine two ML algorithms as potential alternatives\\nto our parametric predictive model of mangrove soil carbon: aboosted decision tree (DT) model and a bag DT model (seeHastie et al 2009 and Breiman 1996 for a detailed description\\nof the two methods respectively). Both are tree-based meth-\\nods, which are well suited for complex ecological data\\n(De ’ath and Fabricius 2000 ), but the relative performance of\\neach method depends on the dataset (Quinlan 1996 ).\\nInputs to the ML models are identical to those in the\\nparametric model. To compare the two ML algorithms withour parametric model, we test the out-of-sample predictivepower of each model. In the out-of-sample prediction tests,weﬁrst draw 1 000 datasets by taking random samples of 30\\nstudies (and all observations from those studies) from our\\noriginal dataset, without replacement. Next, we estimate themachine learning and parametric predictive models for eachof the 1 000 datasets. Finally, we use the estimated models topredict soil carbon concentrations for observations in theremaining 31 studies for each of the 1 000 datasets and cal-culate prediction errors. The magnitude of prediction errors\\nindicates how sensitive the model is to the studies included in\\nour analysis. All models were ﬁtted in MATLAB (2013)\\nversion 8.1.0.604, using the ﬁtensemble package in the sta-\\ntistics toolbox.3. Results\\n3.1. Parametric prediction\\nRegression results are reported in table 1. We begin with a\\nsimple constant-only model showing that the mean soil car-\\nbon content in our sample is 32.14 mg cm−3(min.\\n13.48 mg cm−3, and max. 115 mg cm−3), or approximately an\\naverage of 321 Mg (tons) C ha−1in the top meter of soil. We\\ngradually add controls to the model and ﬁnd that climatic\\nvariables are signi ﬁcant predictors of mangrove soil carbon as\\nare the regional controls. The regional controls contributesubstantially to the explanatory power of the model. For\\nexample, the R-squared for Model 3 with climatic variables\\nbut no regional controls ( ﬁxed effects) is 0.103, but after\\nadding the regional controls the R-squared is 0.912 (Model\\n4). Adding regional controls also lowers the AIC, suggesting\\nthat over ﬁtting is not driving the increased R-squared statistic.\\nFigure 2(left panel) shows the mean soil carbon by\\nregion, and the 95% con ﬁdence intervals around the means,\\nwith and without controls for climate and distance from the\\nequator. Uncontrolled regional means are obtained by\\nregressing soil carbon concentrations on the full set ofregional indicator variables without any other controls. The\\ndata show that mangroves in North and Central America\\ncontain some of the most carbon-rich soils whereas man-\\ngroves in East Asia are among the most carbon-poor soils.\\nSoils in South East Asia, where a large fraction of the world ’s\\nmangroves are located (approx. 32.8%), have considerably\\ngreater carbon content than mangroves soils in East Asia butsubstantially less carbon content than mangrove soils in North\\nand Central America. However, regional constants are no\\nlonger statistically different from each other after controlling\\nfor climate and latitude (right panel of ﬁgure 2).\\nModel 4, which controls for latitude, climatic conditions,\\nand sample region, outperforms all other parametric predic-tions explored here in terms of attaining the highest R-squared\\nand lowest AIC. Therefore, we select it as our preferred\\nparametric speci ﬁcation and compare it to the two ML\\nmodels.Figure 2. Regional variation in soil carbon. The left panel shows regional means without controls for climate and distance from the equator.\\nThe right panel shows regional means conditional on controls for climate and distance from the equator.\\n4Environ. Res. Lett. 9(2014) 104013 S L Jardine and J V Siikamäki3.2. Machine learning predictions\\nTable 2contains results from our out-of-sample predictive\\ntest, where we compare the performance of our preferredparametric prediction model (Model 4) and two competing\\nML algorithms (the boosted decision tree and the bag decision\\ntree). The average sum of squared errors (SSE) and meanpercentage errors (MPE) for each model are summarized inthe table.The results indicate that both ML methods outperform\\nour preferred parametric predictive model by achieving\\nsmaller average out-of-sample SSE and MPE. The improved\\nability of ML models to predict out of sample suggests thatthey offer distinct advantages in modeling mangrove soilcarbon. Of the two ML methods, the bag DT performs betterthan the boosted DT, so we select it as our preferred ML\\nmodel.\\nCommunicating and further using ML model results can\\nbe challenging, as the model cannot be collapsed into anequation. However, in contrast to parametric models we cancalculate the relative importance of each predictor variable in\\nthe ML model (table 3) to gain insight into which predictors\\nexplain the greatest amount of variation in the data. We ﬁnd\\nthat annual precipitation is the most important predictor,followed by distance from the equator and geographic region.\\nPrecipitation seasonality, mean temperature of the coldest\\nquarter, and annual mean temperature explain less of thevariation in mangrove soil carbon.Table 1.

Res. Lett. 9(2014) 104013 S L Jardine and J V SiikamäkiUsing our ML predictive model along with mangrove\\nland cover data from Giri et al (2011 ), we construct a global\\ndataset (available online from the authors) of estimatedmangrove soil carbon concentrations (mg C cm\\n−3) and stocks\\n(Pg C) on a high-resolution grid (5 arc min). Standard errors\\nfor all of our estimates are calculated from the standarddeviation of predictions from 10 000 ML models constructedfrom 10 000 random samples (bootstrap samples) of our pri-mary soil carbon dataset. Figure 3maps the predicted soil\\ncarbon concentrations for the world ’s mangroves and ﬁgure 4\\nmaps mangrove soil carbon concentrations in Indonesia (andneighboring countries), a country that contains roughly 19.5%\\nof the world ’s mangroves. The ﬁgures illustrate considerable\\nspatial variation in mangrove soil carbon concentrations.\\nTo estimate global carbon stocks we assume a carbon-\\nrich soil depth of 1 meter, as common in the literature (e.g.Donato et al 2011 , Pendleton et al 2012 , Siikamäki\\net al 2012 ). Table 4lists the estimated global and country-\\nlevel stock for the top-20 countries. Globally, we estimate thatmangrove soils contain 5.00 ± 0.94 Pg C and that about 80.5%\\nof the pool is contained in 20 countries, which is roughly\\nproportional to the per cent of the world ’s mangroves these\\ncountries contain (81.3%).\\nOur results document considerable geographic variation\\nin soil carbon. We estimate that global mangrove soils contain369 ± 6.8 Mg C ha\\n−1on average (in the top meter). However,\\nwe estimate that the amount of carbon per hectare in theworld ’s most carbon-rich mangroves (the highest grid cell\\nprediction is 703 ± 38 Mg C ha\\n−1) is roughly 2.6 ± 0.14 times\\nthe amount of carbon per hectare in the world ’s most carbon-\\npoor mangroves (the lowest grid cell prediction is272 ± 49 Mg C ha\\n−1). We also ﬁnd substantial within-country\\nvariation in mangrove soil carbon. For example, in Indonesia,the country with globally the largest mangrove soil carbonstock, we estimate that the most carbon-rich mangrovescontain 1.5 ± 0.12 times as much carbon per hectare as the\\nmost carbon-poor mangroves.\\nWhen examining country averages, we ﬁnd that the\\ncountry with the highest average soil carbon concentrationhas roughly twice the amount of soil carbon, per hectare, asthe country with the lowest estimated soil carbon concentra-\\ntion. Interestingly, none of the top 20 countries, when rankedby soil carbon concentrations, overlap with the 20 countrieswith the largest carbon pools (table 4). In fact, the 20 coun-\\ntries with highest average soil carbon concentrations containonly 1.2% of the world ’s mangroves, but as a consequence of\\ntheir relatively high soil carbon, these countries account for\\n1.5% of global mangrove soil carbon.\\n4. Discussion\\nHere we develop a predictive model and global dataset of soil\\ncarbon concentrations, which documents and provides infor-\\nmation on the spatial distributio n of mangrove soil carbon. Our\\nresults indicate that the variation in soil carbon is systematicallydetermined by several climatic variables but that locationalvariables are also signi ﬁcant predictors of mangrove soil carbon.\\nSome of our results call for added discussion. First,\\nalthough Chmura et al (2003 )ﬁnd that soil carbon decreases\\nwith temperature, in our analysis, which includes and expandsbeyond the data in Chmura et al (2003 ), the (parametric)\\nresults show that, on average, carbon content increases with\\ntemperature, albeit at a decreasing rate. Our results are con-sistent with studies that ﬁnd mangrove productivity increases\\nwith temperature up to a threshold (Ellison 2003 , Field 1995 ).\\nSecond, our ﬁndings are consistent with several studies\\nthatﬁnd that extreme cold events have a signi ﬁcant impact on\\nmangrove productivity (Cavanaugh et al 2013 , Sneda-\\nker1995 , Woodroffe and Grindrod 1991 ). For example, our\\n(parametric) results show that a 1 degree C increase in tem-\\nperature during the coldest quarter leads to an increase of5.4 mg cm\\n−3of soil C, all else constant, or a 16.8% increase\\nrelative to the mean value of mangrove soil carbon con-centrations in our sample.\\nThird, we ﬁnd that ML algorithms perform substantially\\nbetter than simple parametric predictions in predicting out ofsample. Therefore, they may offer substantial gains in accu-\\nrately estimating mangrove soil carbon concentrations based\\non available data. On the other hand, the parametric model isexceedingly practical for predictions and, as such it offers auseful ﬁrst-order approximation.\\nFinally, to obtain the highest-quality predictive model\\ngiven available data, we explored several predictive modelingtechniques and compared their performance along severaldimensions. Nonetheless, as with any predictive model, the\\nquality of the predictions depends on the quality of the\\nunderlying data. For example, if the secondary observationsused in this analysis targeted sampling locations based oncharacteristics that are unobservable to us but correlated withsoil carbon concentrations (e.g. oversampling of pristinemangrove forests), then the underlying data would not berepresentative of the population and any predictive modelwould contain selection bias. The possibility that soil carbon\\nmeasurements oversample pristine mangrove locations is\\nspeculated about in Kristensen et al (2008 ) and Hutchinson\\net al (2013 ). Although there is no actual evidence of sampling\\nbias, it cannot be completely ruled out.Table 3. Predictor importance in the bag DT ML model.

We develop a modelto predict mangrove soil carbon, explaining substantial spatialvariation in the carbon concentrations of global mangrove\\nsoils. Our predictive model is based on a rich dataset ofmangrove soil carbon measurements, including over 900observations collected in 28 countries throughout the world,which represent the majority of global mangroves. Using\\nFigure 3. Global map of predicted mangrove soil carbon concentrations.\\nFigure 4. Map of predicted mangrove soil carbon concentrations for Indonesia (and neighboring countries).\\n7Environ. Res. Lett. 9(2014) 104013 S L Jardine and J V Siikamäkithe model predictions, we produce a high-resolution and\\nspatially explicit global dataset of mangrove soil carbon\\nconcentrations. These data can help examine current man-grove conservation projects and direct future mangrove con-\\nservation efforts, thus providing an important scienti ﬁc input\\nto mangrove conservation assessments.\\nBecause mangrove soil concentrations are determined by\\nclimate conditions, our predictive model can also help assess\\nthe impacts of a changing climate on carbon in mangrove soils,\\ni.e. our model can be used to predict changes in mangrove soilcarbon concentrations that result from changing climate con-\\nditions. This will allow for a more complete understanding of\\nthe impacts of climate change on mangroves.\\nMangrove carbon storage varies substantially over space;\\ntherefore, the bene ﬁts from mangrove conservation depend\\ncritically on the location of the mangroves conserved. In\\nprinciple, our results enable the targeting of mangrove con-servation to maximize bene ﬁts from avoided carbon emissions.\\nWe note, however, that a more meaningfully de ﬁned con-\\nservation strategy should consider the full range of bene ﬁts\\nfrom mangrove conservation, not only avoided carbon emis-\\nsions. Moreover, it is not clear ap r i o r i how similar or different\\na more multi-objective targeting strategy would be relative to a\\ncarbon-focused targeting. Although previous research (Sii-\\nkamäki et al 2012 ) suggests that, in general, carbon-focusedmangrove conservation will target areas that are also high in\\nbiodiversity, the relationship between carbon and biodiversitymay vary at a ﬁner spatial scale than has been considered thus\\nfar in the literature. Additionally, it is unclear whether the manyother bene ﬁts, such as shoreline protection or the provision of\\nnursery habitat for ﬁsh, from mangrove conservation are\\nstrongly and positively correlated with the potential for carbon\\noffsets in mangroves. Therefore, to develop a more compre-hensive understanding of mangrove conservation, future workis needed to evaluate the full array of ecosystem services thatmangroves provide. Our results can be an important input intothese future comprehensive assessments.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe thank Daniel Donato and Erik Kristensen for their\\nassistance with the data.

Introduction\\nMangrove forests, which are found in saline coastal environ-\\nments around the tropical and subtropical latitudes, are among the\\nmost productive terrestrial ecosystems in the world ( Amarasinghe\\nand Balasubramaniam, 1992 ;Myint et al., 2008 ). These forests play\\nan important role in providing ecological and societal goods and\\nservices to local communities ( Wang et al., 2004 ;Giri and\\nMuhlhausen, 2008 ), including stabilizing shorelines and helping\\nreduce the devastating impact of natural disasters such as tsunamisand hurricanes ( Giri et al., 2007 ;Zhang et al., 2012 ), serving as\\nbreeding and nursing grounds for many marine and pelagic species\\n(Giri and Muhlhausen, 2008 ), and providing food, medicine, fuel,\\nand building materials as well as opportunities for aquaculture\\n(Thu and Populus, 2007 ;Myint et al., 2008 ). As a consequence,\\nmangrove ecosystems have attracted an increasing amount of\\nattention from land and ocean managers, conservation commu-\\nnities and academia. However, many mangrove communities,\\nespecially those in the developing regions, are currently being\\nsubjected to disturbances from a variety of sources, including un-\\ncontrolled encroachment due to increasing populations in coastal\\nareas, various destructive human activities (e.g., chemical spills) in\\nsurrounding catchments, tsunamis and other storms, and climate\\nchange ( Manson et al., 2003 ;Giri and Muhlhausen, 2008 ).Duke*Corresponding author.\\nE-mail address: nfulms@yahoo.com.cn (M.S.

(2007) recorded that in some regions, due to illegal logging,\\nmangroves have been declining at an alarming rate eperhaps\\ngreater than or equal to the declines in adjacent coral reefs or\\ntropical forests. Valiela et al. (2001) andWilkie and Fortuna (2003)\\nobserved that much of what remains from mangrove deforestation\\nstays in degraded condition. Further, Alongi (2008) argued that\\nmangrove stand composition and forest structure results from the\\ncomplex interplay of physiological tolerances and competitive in-\\nteractions, leading to a mosaic of interrupted or arrested succession\\nsequences, all of which are strongly impacted by physical/chemical\\ngradients and landform changes. Obviously, the mangroves around\\nthe world, especially those in the developing regions, are experi-\\nencing an intense spatio-temporal change. Regrettably, our un-\\nderstanding regarding the spatio-temporal dynamics and\\ncorresponding underlying drivers of change in most developing\\ncountries remains inadequate, in part because the mangrove\\ncommunities are changing at a rapid rate and because the changes\\nare very much site-speci ﬁc. These changes are occurring in\\nresponse to changing development and demographic pressure,\\nwhich run counter to the development of targeted strategies and\\npractices that promote the sustainable management of the existingmangroves.\\nChina ’s mangroves naturally occur along the southeast Chinese\\ncoastlines and in the provinces of Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi,\\nFujian and Taiwan, intermittently extending from 18\\n/C14Nt o2 7/C14N(Li\\nand Lee, 1997 ;Fu et al., 2009 ). Historically, half of China ’s mangrove\\nwetlands were distributed in Guangdong province ( Wang and\\nChen, 1998 ). It is notable that 80% of the mangroves of Guang-\\ndong province were located in Zhanjiang city. However, rapid urban\\nsprawl and an increasingly intensi ﬁed shrimp farming industry\\ntriggered by huge demographic and development pressure cata-\\nlyzed a drastic decline of mangroves, diminishing mangrove spatial\\nextent from 62 000 ha in the 1950 ’s to 15 000 ha in the late 1990 ’s\\n(Wang and Chen, 1998 ). Mangrove decline continued into the late\\n20st century. According to the latest inventory of mangrove re-\\nsources, mainland China had a total of 23 081.5 ha mangroves in\\n2008, 39.4% (9084 ha) of which existed in Guangdong province,\\noccupying the greatest area share ( Fu et al., 2009 ). Fortunately, with\\nthe establishment of mangrove national reserves since 1997 in\\nGuangdong province, continued mangrove afforestation and con-\\nservation efforts have expanded mangrove distribution to some\\nextent in certain protected areas. Due to the spatial extent and the\\nbiodiversity conservation priority of Guangdong ’s mangroves,\\nnumerous mangrove-oriented studies have been conducted there.\\nThese investigations primarily focused on the following aspects: (1)\\nmangrove wetlands protection and management ( Chen et al., 2004 ;\\nZhang et al., 2010 ), (2) mangrove community distribution ( Li et al.,\\n2002 ;Tang and Yu, 2007 ), (3) mangrove wetlands valuing ( Han\\net al., 2000 ), (4) birds in mangroves ( Zou et al., 2008 ;Wu, 2009 )\\nand (5) vegetation rehabilitation of mangroves ( Zheng et al., 1997 ,\\n2003 ). Furthermore, the analyses focused on mangrove protection\\nand management. Development and planning were mainly based\\non qualitative and descriptive methods, and there was a lack of\\nspatially explicit information on mangrove distribution and change.\\nFew investigations conducted in Guangdong province were focused\\non the spatio-temporal changes in mangrove distributions, and nostudies assessed mangrove fragmentation patterns. Thus, the rates,\\ncauses, and consequences of mangrove changes have not been\\nadequately documented. Such information would support the\\nstrategic development of sustainable mangrove management at\\ndiverse scales, and would be invaluable for assessing the effec-\\ntiveness of the existing mangrove management approaches. Hence,\\nmapping and monitoring mangrove dynamics in an accurate, reli-\\nable and ef ﬁcient fashion and providing spatially explicit infor-\\nmation on mangrove fragmentation are important to differentlevels of governments and conservation communities for effective\\nformulations of strategies and plans on mangrove management.\\nThe major objectives of this work were: (1) to derive land use\\ntime series data sets from multi-temporal Landsat observations for\\nGaoqiao and Yingzai mangrove areas, which are the two prototypes\\nof Zhanjiang National Mangrove Forest Nature Reserve, (2) to\\ncharacterize changes in mangrove distribution and fragmentation\\npatterns, and to (3) link the observed fragmentation trends to the\\nlocal biodiversity dynamics to provide insights, implications and\\ncountermeasures of mangrove sustainable management.\\n2. Data and study area\\nZhanjiang National Mangrove Forests Nature Reserve, due to the\\ndominance of mangroves in the area and its extremely high\\nbiodiversity signi ﬁcance, was chosen as our study site in the current\\nwork. This reserve is the largest national-level natural reserve for\\nmangrove protection in mainland China. The reserve was originally\\nestablished in 1991, and it was approved for elevation in rank to a\\nnational reserve by the State Council of China in 1997, in part\\nbecause of its importance for biodiversity conservation. The reservehas a notably rich ﬂora and fauna, and includes 28 mangrove spe-\\ncies, 139 ﬁsh species, 130 conch species, 133 insect species and 192\\nbird species. Of these, 25 species have been listed in national-level\\nconservation directories, 34 species are listed in the key conser-\\nvation lists of Guangdong province, and 82 species are listed in\\ndiverse international agreements directories ( Integrated Mangrove\\nManagement and Coastal Protection Program Of ﬁce, 2006 ).\\nParticularly, the Zhanjiang mangrove national natural reserve was\\ndeclared as a Ramsar site in January 2002, qualifying it as one of\\nthirty “Wetlands of International Importance ”in China. In recent\\nyears, mangrove coastlines have also become an attractive hotspot\\nfor eco-tourism and environmental education programs.\\nZhanjiang city covers a land area of 12 471 km2, supporting a\\ntotal population of around 7.0 million. The city is located at the\\nsouthernmost tip of Mainland China on Leizhou Peninsula in the\\nnorthern tropical zone spanning from 109/C14400E, 20/C14150Nt o\\n110/C14550E, 21/C14550N. The annual average temperature is about 23/C14and\\nthe coldest monthly average temperature of 17.2/C14occurs in January.\\nThe area receives abundant precipitation, with an average annual\\nprecipitation of about 1500 mm. The average tidal range is about\\n2.53 m, and the annual average temperature of the surface sea\\nwater is about 23.7/C14, with a salinity ranging from 29.7 &to 32.0&.\\nThe two prototype mangrove sites, Gaoqiao and Yingzai in Lian-\\njiang city ( Fig. 1 ), were identi ﬁed as our research targets in the\\ncurrent analysis mainly because both areas are dominated by\\nmangrove forests and have high levels of biodiversity.\\nSatellite imagery used in the work included ﬁve cloud-free\\nLandsat scenes: (1) MultiSpectral Scanner (MSS) scene, acquired\\non February 2, 1977, with a spatial resolution of 80 m; (2) Thematic\\nMapper (TM) scene, dated on October 30, 1991, with a resolution of\\n28.5 m; (3) Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM þ) scene, dated\\non October 30, 2000, 28.5 m resolution; (4) TM scene dated on\\nNovember 21, 2005, 30 m resolution and (5) TM scene, acquired onAugust 30, 2010, 30 m resolution. These scenes were downloaded\\nfrom the Global Land Cover Facility ( http://glcf.umiacs.umd.edu/\\nindex.shtml ) at the University of Maryland or the USGS EROS\\nData Center ( http://glovis.usgs.gov/ ). Additionally, a ﬁeld visit was\\nconducted from December 1 through 4, 2010 to (1) identify land use\\ntypes and mangrove disturbances in the two prototype areas, and\\n(2) to collect the administrative histories of the reserve and\\nbiodiversity change information through interviewing and\\nrecording aged people living near the reserve and local experts of\\nthe reserve. The 2001 mangrove thematic inventory data of\\nGuangdong province, and the mangrove afforestation statisticsM.S. Li et al. / Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 130 (2013) 111 e120 112were collected from the Guangdong Provincial Center for Forest\\nResources Monitoring. Socio-economic data and publications\\nrelated to mangrove management were also obtained from the\\nZhanjiang Mangrove Management and Protection Bureau. Vector-\\nized land use data sets for 1980 ’s, 1995, 2000 and 2005 covering the\\nstudy areas, developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)\\nwere also collected to support the analysis. True color air photo-\\ngraphs taken on July 13, 2000 and August 7, 2009, originally ac-\\nquired for local land use surveys, were also obtained from the localsurveying and mapping agency to validate the classi ﬁcations of this\\nanalysis.\\n3. Methods3.1. Image preprocessing\\nBefore classi ﬁcation, exoatmospheric re ﬂectance images (top of\\natmosphere re ﬂectance) for the ﬁve scenes were generated. This\\nFig. 1. Locations of the study sites. The red areas show our prototype study sites, Gaoqiao and Yingzai. (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is\\nreferred to the web version of this article.)M.S. Li et al. / Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 130 (2013) 111 e120 113was done by radiometrically calibrating the images using the latest\\npublished post-launch gain and offset constants to eliminate the\\nerrors caused by changes in sensor performance and characteristics\\nover time ( Chander et al., 2009 ). Due to the de ﬁciency in real-time\\nand complete pro ﬁles of atmosphere at the ﬁve time points, at-\\nmospheric corrections of the exoatmospheric re ﬂectance images\\nwere not implemented here. After that, the ﬁve scenes were\\ngeometrically corrected and resampled to a pixel size of 28.5 m\\nusing a 2-order polynomial equation built upon a total of 13 ground\\ncontrol points identi ﬁed from the local topographic map, with a\\nscale of 1 versus 10 000, with RMS less than 0.5 pixels. The local 3/C14\\nzonation Gauss-Kruger projection was speci ﬁed during the\\ngeometrical correction process.\\n3.2. Image classi ﬁcation\\nAfter extensive consultation with the local natural resource\\nmanagement experts and the established land use data, ﬁve land\\nuse and land cover types for the study sites were determined: (1)\\nmangrove, (2) intertidal zone or sandy area, (3) water, (4) aquafarm\\nfor shrimp and crab growing and (5) non-such (cropland, buildingsand roads). To derive actual land use maps, the unsupervised Iter-\\native Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique Algorithm (ISO-\\nDATA) was implemented to create 30 spectral clusters. This was\\nfollowed by the conversion from the spectral classes to the actual\\nland cover and land use classes by on-screen checking and labeling\\nin accordance with the objects ’locations, textures, tones or colors,\\nas well as the existing reference data (e.g., the thematic surveys of\\nmangrove and the land use data) and the inputs of the local experts.\\nPost-classi ﬁcations or further improvements to the classi ﬁcations\\nwere also made by eliminating apparent gross errors through hand\\nediting.\\n3.3. Assessing the accuracies of classi ﬁcation\\nOnce image classi ﬁcations were done, with the aid of the local\\nexperts for natural resources management, visual interpretation of\\nthe air photos taken in 2000 and 2009 was implemented to produce\\nthe reference data, which were used to validate the classi ﬁcation\\naccuracies of the Landsat images. The four-point historical land use\\ndata collected from the CAS were not used to assess the accuracies\\nbecause of their relative coarse resolutions (1 e0.1 million), and the\\n2001 thematic mangrove surveys were also excluded from the\\nvalidation processes due to their over-estimation of the mangrove\\ncoverage. The overall accuracies for the ﬁve identi ﬁed land use\\nclasses and the spatial agreement for the mangrove class were\\ncalculated respectively to assess the classi ﬁcations.\\n3.4. Modeling mangrove landscape fragmentation\\nPrior to modeling mangrove landscape fragmentation, the\\noriginal land cover and land use types were aggregated to focus on\\nthe patterns of forest (mangrove) versus non-forest (aquafarm and\\nnon-such) and missing values (intertidal zone plus water), to\\nfacilitate subsequent fragmentation modeling analysis. The missing\\nvalue class was not allowed to fragment the mangroves in thecurrent analysis. Based on the sliding window analysis technique,\\nthe forest fragmentation model outlined in Wade et al. (2003) was\\nused to develop spatially explicit maps depicting six forest frag-\\nmentation components (interior, perforated, edge, patch, transi-\\ntional and undetermined) at the analytical scale of 3 by 3 pixels.\\nThis model has been proven to be an effective alternative in char-\\nacterizing forest fragmentation at diverse scales ( Riitters et al.,\\n2000 ,2002 ;Wade et al., 2003 ). To run the model, two indices, P\\nf\\nand P ff, were derived beforehand, where P fis the proportion ofnonmissing pixels within the moving window with a speci ﬁed size\\nthat are forest, and P ffis the ratio of the number of pixel pairs in\\ncardinal directions that are both forest divided by the number of\\npixel pairs in cardinal directions where either one or both are\\nforested. Roughly, P ffmeasures the conditional probability that a\\npixel adjacent to a forest pixel is also forest. Once the P fand P ffwere\\navailable, each subject forest pixel centered within the moving\\nwindow was classi ﬁed into one of the six forest fragmentation\\ncategories described previously by applying the discriminant rules\\noutlined by Riitters et al. (2000) .\\n3.5. Bird surveys\\nMangrove fragmentation conditions were linked with changes\\nin biodiversity of the reserve using routinely collected bird popu-\\nlation survey data ( Integrated Mangrove Management and Coastal\\nProtection Program Of ﬁce, 2006 ;Wu, 2009 ). During the period\\n2002 to 2003, sampling was implemented during three periods\\nspanning three seasons: winter (December 23, 2002 to January 13,\\n2003), spring (March 3, 2003 to March 22, 2003) and summer (June\\n23, 2003 to July 10, 2003) to test the hypothesis that bird speciesrichness and abundance were equal over seasons. After 2005, bird\\nsurveys were carried out mainly in spring. The number of sampling\\nsessions was proportional to the area of mangrove, intertidal zone\\nand aquafarm at each site. A combination of point counts and\\ntransect counts were made for the intertidal zone, and 17 transects\\nwere set up in the mangroves ( Zou et al., 2008 ;Wu, 2009 ). Point\\ncount samplers documented all birds seen and heard within a 150-\\nm radius of designated center points during 10-min sampling pe-\\nriods. Transect counts were 50-m wide and 1000-m long. Average\\nsample time for each transect was about 120 min. Bird species and\\nnumbers seen or heard were recorded for all transects using\\nmethods described by Zou et al. (2001) . The time of day for sam-\\npling was selected based on tidal levels. Birds on intertidal zones\\nwere sampled during low tides when the zones were exposed and\\nbirds could access them. Birds in mangrove were sampled during\\nhigh tides when birds could not access intertidal zones. Binoculars\\n(10/C2) and spotting scopes (30 /C2and 60 /C2) were used for detecting\\nand identifying birds ( Zou et al., 2008 ).\\n4. Results4.1. Accuracy assessment\\nAfter interpreting the 2000 and 2009 air photos, the classi ﬁca-\\ntions derived from the Landsat scenes were evaluated. The overall\\naccuracies of the 2000 and 2010 classi ﬁcation results were esti-\\nmated at 92.3% and 89.7% respectively. The spatial agreement of\\nmangroves was identi ﬁed at 91.1% for 2000 and 90.3% for 2010. It\\nneeds to be noted that the air photos used were acquired for local\\nland use surveys and not exclusively for mangrove mapping. These\\nwere acquired at 11:23 AM, July 13, 2000 and at 11:47 AM, August 7,\\n2009. Similar to the Landsat observations, the air photos were\\ncollected when the local tides were relatively high. This helps\\nexplain why there was a relatively high spatial agreement of\\nmangroves derived from between the air photos and the Landsatscenes. Due to the unavailability of the reference data, we were\\nunable to quantitatively evaluate the classi ﬁcations for 1977, 1991\\nand 2005.\\n4.2. Changes in mangroves and aquafarm areas\\nFig. 2 shows the land use time series maps for Gaoqiao (left) and\\nYingzai (right). Associated area statistics derived from Fig. 2 are\\nsummarized in Fig. 3 . Mangroves in both Gaoqiao and YingzaiM.S. Li et al. / Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 130 (2013) 111 e120 114showed a similar trend characterized by a sharp decrease during\\nthe period 1977 e1991 giving way to an increase during the period\\n1991 to 2010 ( Fig. 3 ). Speci ﬁcally, mangrove estimates for Gaoqiao\\nand Yingzai were 145 ha and 53 ha in 1977, 69 ha and 42 ha in 1991,\\n354 ha and 157 ha in 2000, 381 ha and 242 ha in 2005, and 453 ha\\nand 353 ha in 2010, respectively. Aquaculture areas in the two sites\\nincreased during the period 1977 to 2005, then decreased ( Fig. 3 ).\\nIn detail, aquaculture areas were extremely scarce at both sites in\\n1977 ( Figs. 2 and 3). However, in 1991, 137 ha and 1769 ha of\\naquafarms were mapped in Gaoquio and Yingzai, respectively. In2000, aquaculture increased to 490 ha in Gaoqiao and 2439 ha in\\nYingzai, then continuously increased to 495 ha and 2526 ha,\\nrespectively, in 2005. During the period 2005 to 2010, Gaoqiao ’s\\naquaculture dropped to 274 ha and Yingzai ’s aquaculture decreased\\nto 1930 ha ( Fig. 3 ). Additionally, examination of Fig. 2 reveals that a\\nlarge-scale sandy area over Gaoqiao in 1977 was changed into\\nwater in 1991. Similarly, in Yinzai, sandy area was converted to\\nwater and aquafarms during the period 1977 e1991. After 1991,\\nthere was a clear trend of mangroves expanding into water at both\\nGaoqiao and Yingzai sites.\\nFig. 2. Changes in land uses during the period 1977 to 2010 over Gaoqiao (Left) and Yingzai (Right) sites, derived from classifying multi-temporal Landsat sc enes.M.S. Li et al. / Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 130 (2013) 111 e120 1154.3. Mangrove fragmentation patterns characterized by the\\nfragmentation model\\nAfter running the fragmentation model at the analytical win-\\ndow size of 3 by 3 pixels, mangrove fragmentation maps weregenerated ( Fig. 4 ) and associated statistics were summarized\\n(Fig. 5 ) to highlight the trends of mangrove fragmentation. At this\\nanalytical scale, interior and perforated components were abso-\\nlutely predominant over the other four fragmentation conditions at\\ntheﬁve time points. Apparently, acceleration in fragmentation of\\nmangroves occurred during the period 1977 e1991, followed by a\\ngradual deceleration in fragmentation during the period 1991 e\\n2010 ( Fig. 5 ). This pattern was evidenced by a fact that interior\\nmangrove forests of the two sites dropped sharply during the\\nperiod 1977 e1991, giving way to a gradual increase during the\\nperiod 1991 e2010. A continued but slight increase of the perfo-\\nrated component in Gaoqiao was observed during the whole period\\n1977e2010. However, in Yingzai, the perforated component ﬂuc-\\ntuated over time ( Fig. 5 ). Compared to the widely used geospatial\\nmetrics, such as, the patch size and the fractal dimensions, the\\nfragmentation maps provide more insights and implications to\\nmangrove management and biodiversity conservation practice due\\nto their spatially explicit information on fragmentation.\\n5. Discussion5.1. Satellite-based mangrove mapping affected by the local tidal\\nrhythms\\nMangrove forests are highly productive ecosystems that typi-\\ncally dominate the intertidal zone of tropical and subtropical\\ncoastlines ( Kathiresan and Bingham, 2001 ). Thus, mangrove dis-\\ntribution is undoubtedly dependent upon the local tidal rhythms\\nand varies with the changes of tidal inundation. The tidal rhythms\\nor periods over a particular place are fully determined by the lunar\\ncalendar (lunar gravity), which means that different dates in thelunar calendar will have different times for high versus low tides.\\nMeanwhile, the Landsat satellites pass over particular locations and\\nacquire data during extremely short time intervals, and depending\\non the day may acquire coastal data at high tide, low tide, or\\nsomewhere in between. Thus, mangrove distributions mapped by\\nsatellite remote sensing will be highly affected by the local tidal\\nlevels. The 2001 mangrove resource thematic inventory conducted\\nin Guangdong province revealed that a total of 700.9 ha mangroves\\nexisted in Gaoqiao and 388.1 ha in Yingzai. However, our estimates\\nderived from ETM þimagery dated on October 30, 2000 were at\\n381 ha in Gaoqiao and 157 ha in Yingzai, respectively. Obviously,there is a big discrepancy between the two sets of statistics. The\\nmost probable reasons responsible for the gaps are three-fold. First,\\ndifferences in tidal levels of the two surveys likely impacted results.\\nThe thematic survey of mangrove resources was conducted by on-\\nsite human delineation when the tide was low. Our remotelysensed observations were acquired at about 9:50 AM, October 30,\\n2000. According to the records from the local oceanic observatory\\nstation, on October 30, 2000, high tide occurred at 7:00 AM, with a\\ntidal height of 5.15 m and the low tide of 0.4 m occurred at 5:00 PM.\\nThe actual tidal height for the time when the satellite acquired data\\nwas about 3.73 m. Thus, a number of mangroves, especially the\\nstands consisting of young mangrove seedlings, were undoubtedly\\nﬂooded. This would have led to the mangrove area mapped by\\nsatellite imagery being far less than that collected from the ﬁeld\\nsurveys. Actually, Alongi (2008) ,Giri et al. (2007) and Liu et al.\\n(2008) have all noted the effects of tidal inundation on the\\nsatellite-based mangrove area estimates. Based on the available\\ntidal information, Liu et al. (2008) ignored the minor differences of\\ntriple-temporal tides and argued that the triple-temporal\\nmangrove classi ﬁcations based on Landsat observations were\\nroughly comparable. Due to the unavailability of the local tidal in-\\nformation, Giri et al. (2007 ,\\n2008 ) were unable to further explore\\nthe effects of tidal inundation on satellite-based mangrove map-\\nping. These existing studies and our current work collectively face a\\nchallenge that is how to minimize the impacts of different tidal\\nlevels upon the visibility of mangroves, or how to make the map-\\nping results comparable when using multi-temporal remotely\\nsensed observations, and the challenge also necessitates seeking\\nsubstitutes, for example, the aerial photography. A second reason\\nfor the discrepancies between our results and survey statistics\\nlikely relates to the differences in the years when measurements\\nwere made. The ground data from the thematic survey did not\\ncorrespond with the date of satellite data classi ﬁed, and there was a\\ntime lag of about one year between when the maps were made. It is\\nlikely that some mangrove afforestation occurred over the time\\nperiod between when our satellite data were acquired and when\\nthe survey was conducted. A third reason for discrepancies likely\\ninvolved differences in measurement scales. The thematic surveywas implemented from extensive ﬁeld visits. Field manual de-\\nlineations of mangrove patches usually overestimates mangrove\\narea due to errors of human vision obstacles (e.g. obstructed sight)\\nand de ﬁciency in reference objects throughout the ﬂat intertidal\\nzones. For example, human delineation of the mangroves often\\nincludes mangroves and their adjacent water bodies and sandy\\nareas, which leads to an overestimation. This was likely the case,\\nand Giri et al. (2007) also made the same observation when\\nmonitoring mangrove dynamics of the Sundarbans in BangladeshFig. 3. Areal changes in mangroves and aquaculture areas over Gaoqiao and Yingzai sites.M.S. Li et al. / Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 130 (2013) 111 e120 116and India. It should also be noted that our satellite-based deriva-\\ntions resulted from interpreting 30-m resolution spectral images.\\nUndoubtedly, existence of mixed pixels led to some areal errors,\\nespecially in areas that had diverse land use types. For example, the\\nthematic ﬁeld survey certainly included newly-established\\nmangrove seedling patches in their maps. However, the LandsatTM sensor was spectrally unable to discriminate these areas\\nadequately due to their relative low crown closure in the dominant\\ncontext of water.\\nMapping mangroves is still a challenging task due to a variety of\\nreasons, such as low accessibility of the intertidal zones, and\\nchanging tidal levels. It is relatively rare that we have access to\\nFig. 4. Spatio-temporal dynamics of mangrove fragmentation, derived from implementing the fragmentation model at the analytical scale of 3 by 3 pixels.M.S. Li et al. / Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 130 (2013) 111 e120 117satellite remotely sensed data acquired at the absolute lowest tides\\nwhen mangrove mapping is optimal. Meanwhile, clouds and at-\\nmospheric properties can diminish the potential number of optimal\\nscenes to analyze. Thus, satellite-based approaches tend to under-\\nestimate mangrove distribution. Aerial photography can effectively\\nadapt to the local tidal cycles by selectively targeting acquisitions of\\ndata at times of low tide. In addition, it is generally easier to work\\naround clouds and atmospheric problems with aerial photograph\\nacquisitions. Meanwhile, the problems typically encountered with\\nﬁeld surveys (e.g. human site obstructions) can be minimized\\nthrough air photo analysis. Hence, to accurately map or monitor\\nmangrove dynamics in a particular place, aerial photography can be\\nan efﬁcient and ﬂexible alternative.\\n5.2. Biodiversity and environmental implications of mangrove\\nfragmentation\\nThe amount of mangroves present generally determines the\\nmangroves located in either interior or edge. The relative ratio of\\ninterior over edge provides a measure of mangrove ecosystem\\nhealth. Different mangrove conditions have signi ﬁcant impacts on\\nthe distributions of mangrove-dependent organisms, such as birds.\\nFor example, Wu (2009) argued that the intact interior mangrove\\nareas were quite suitable for birds because they should afford better\\nprotection against capture than small forest patches. Although\\nfragmentation components or categories can serve as spatial in-\\ndicators for assessing whether critical components or functions ofmangroves are being maintained, mangrove edges and perforations\\nhave less value where the amount of forest is low ( Soledad and\\nSantiago, 2005 ). This is especially true because isolation can easily\\noccur when the mangrove landscape is highly fragmented, affecting\\nbiological exchanges throughout the mangroves. Particularly, some\\nground-nesting birds will be signi ﬁcantly affected by the distance\\nbetween mangrove patches ( Uezu et al., 2005 ). The increasing\\nisolation of mangrove patches may also have substantial impacts on\\nsome threatened species by reducing the genetic ﬂow between\\nsubpopulations. Sometimes, investigators have suggested that we\\nplace more attention on the perforated condition rather than“patch ”, because the places most likely to exhibit qualitative future\\nchanges will not be in the region of existing patches, but in the\\nsurrounding halo of perforated forest ( Riitters et al., 2000 ). The\\nexisting fragmented areas, for instance, the “edge ”and perforated\\nmangroves mapped by the model, will be more easily further\\ndegraded and fragmented due to erosion, siltation, sedimentation\\nand anthropogenic disturbances due to their high accessibility. Thus,\\nit is emphasized that conservation and oceanic management stra-\\ntegies should always consider the quality of the whole mangrove\\nlandscape and especially the number of different mangrove habitats\\nand their spatial arrangement ( Steiner and Köhler, 2003 ).\\nThe fragmentation model used in this study enabled generation\\nof a suite of spatially explicit fragmentation maps that are effective\\nfor assessing mangrove restoration potential. These maps can help\\nto spatially convey decision-makers ’recommendations on conser-\\nvation strategies. For instance, this information can be used to plan\\nthe expansion of the interior condition and to ﬁll in the perforated\\nregions, or to reduce vulnerability by better managing the places\\nnear the critical thresholds set by the percolation theory. Human-\\ncontrolled activities, including identifying the proper sites and\\napproaches of mangrove logging, regeneration, afforestation, as\\nwell as chemical spill controlling activities, are the typical measures\\nthat can be assessed from adequately utilizing the spatial frag-\\nmentation pattern information provided by the model. Through\\nproviding the spatial fragmentation information from the model,\\ntheﬁndings in the current analysis will be helpful for mangrove\\nlandscape management by guiding the scienti ﬁc development of\\nutilization and conservation strategies.\\nLocated in one of the East Siberian-Australasian ﬂ\\nyways,\\nattracting a variety of migrating birds and resident birds to rest,\\nforage and breed, Zhanjiang National Mangrove Forest Natural\\nReserve is referred to as “the heaven of birds ”and plays an\\nextremely important role in biodiversity conservation, particularly\\nbird biodiversity ( Liu and Li, 2001 ;Liu, 2007 ;Zou et al., 2008 ;Wu,\\n2009 ). Currently, monitoring the dynamics of bird populations,\\nespecially the waterfowl, has been routine at the reserve. Changes\\nin bird species and population numbers may be an effective mea-\\nsure of mangrove quantity, quality and fragmentation conditionsGao qiao\\n01020304050\\n1977 1991 2000 2005 2010\\nTimeAreal percentage(%)Interior\\nPerforated\\nEdge\\nPatch\\nTransitional\\nUndetermined\\nYingzai\\n01020304050607080\\n1977 1991 2000 2005 2010\\nTi meAreal percentage(%)Interior\\nPerforated\\nEdge\\nPatch\\nTrans itional\\nUndetermined\\nFig. 5. Comparative patterns of the six mangrove fragmentation components, during the period 1977 to 2010.M.S. Li et al. / Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 130 (2013) 111 e120 118and are of local economic interest. For example, the price of the teal\\n(Anas crecca ), a mangrove-dependent local waterfoul species, went\\nup to 200 Yuan RMB (1 US Dollar equals to 6.3 Yuan RMB currently)\\ndriven by the Cantonese desire to eat the teal. Thus, the illegal\\ncapture and selling of the teal frequently occurred, leading to a\\nsharp decline of the teal population of the mangrove reserve.\\nInterestingly, staff at the reserve witnessed that the teal started to\\ngather in the core portions of the mangrove reserve to avoid from\\ncapture in recent years. Thus, increase in mangrove coverage or\\nreduction in mangrove fragmentation will provide the teal better\\nprotection. Another fully opposite case involves the ﬁddler crabs\\n(Uca arcuata ). Due to its low edibility and the over-feeding when\\ngrowing in association with the shrimp and crabs being aqua-\\nfarmed it population showed a marked increase during the past ten\\nyears. The ﬁddler crabs prefer the edge and perforated components\\nof the mangroves to obtain more sunshine, wind and movement\\nopportunities ( Integrated Mangrove Management and Coastal\\nProtection Program Of ﬁce, 2006 ).\\nDue to diverse beach development programs, especially the\\nconstruction of shrimp and crab farms, mangrove forests have\\nshrunk gradually, leading to a sharp decline in livable mangrovehabitats during the period 1977 to 1991 ( Figs. 2 and3).Thampanya\\net al. (2006) also observed the same phenomenon in Thailand and\\nconcluded that mangrove loss was higher in the presence of shrimp\\nfarms and in areas where mangrove forests used to be extensive in\\nthe past. Additionally, owing to a long-term unlawful discharge of\\nthe industrial wastewater and domestic sewage, and an over-use of\\nﬁsh bait, eutrophication of the coastal water has intensi ﬁed. This\\nhas posed a serious threat to mangrove habitats and has contrib-\\nuted to a disappearance of swans ( Cygnus spp.) over the past ﬁfteen\\nyears and an acute reduction of raptors such as the kestrel ( Falco\\ntinnunculus ), and black-winged kite ( Elanus caeruleus ). Since 2005,\\nwaterfowl species and numbers within the reserve have increased\\ngradually in response to gradual improvement of the mangrove\\nfragmentation and degradation conditions observed. Speci ﬁcally,\\nChinese pond-heron ( Ardeola bacchus ), great egret ( Ardea alba ) and\\nblack-collared starling ( Sternus nigricollis ) populations have\\nincreased by 10 e20%, and spot-necked dove ( Streptopelia chinensis )\\nhas increased by about 30%. The observed increase is principally\\nattributed to the expansion of mangroves and the observed\\nreduction of mangrove fragmentation, and the reinforcement of the\\nenvironmental protection awareness of local dwellers, catalyzed by\\ndiverse programs for mangrove reforestation and conservation and\\neducational programs executed. A bird survey for Gaoqiao (one of\\nthe mangrove study sites) summarized in Table 1 suggests that\\nmangrove conservation practice at this site has signi ﬁcantly\\nimproved the quality of mangrove habitats and attracted greater\\nnumbers birds to reproduce ( Zou et al., 2008 ;Wu, 2009 ). It is clear\\nthat since 2005, the number of bird species and the total numbers\\nof birds have gradually increased and the individual populations\\nhave expanded over time. Particularly, the ﬁrst appearance of the\\nworld ’s endangered species, black-faced spoonbill ( Platalea minor) ,\\nin April 2006 at the Gaoqiao site, is highly notable. This bird species\\nwas found again in January 2008. Emergence of this particularendangered bird species twice signi ﬁcantly improved the interna-\\ntional status of the reserve and further promoted the protection\\nefforts of birds. Wu (2009) conducted a systematic survey on\\nwaterfowl throughout the mangrove forests of Zhanjiang and also\\nfound a similar trend in bird numbers as we have presented here.\\nSpeci ﬁcally, the number of waterfowl for 2005, 2006, 2008 and\\n2009 observed were 1272, 2173, 2377 and 3338 respectively, and\\nthe number of waterfowl species was recorded at 24, 28, 20 and 31\\naccordingly. Clearly, these ﬁndings are fully consistent with our\\nobservations in Gaoqiao. The above-mentioned observations on\\nbiodiversity (mainly birds) help demonstrate the signi ﬁcance of\\nexpanding the interior component of mangroves. Healthy\\nmangrove forests provide adequate breeding and nursing grounds,\\nfood and shelter for birds. Therefore, expanding the distribution of\\nmangroves, mitigating the fragmentation of mangroves via affor-\\nestation, conservation and education programs are important for\\nbiodiversity conservation in Zhanjiang mangrove reserve.\\n5.3. Uncertainties\\nClassi ﬁcations of satellite imagery into land cover and land use\\ntypes always have a certain degree of error and uncertainty asso-\\nciated with them. Analyses of mangroves change and fragmenta-\\ntion patterns of the present study are undoubtedly affected by\\nerrors in the classi ﬁcations. Obviously, commission errors and\\nomission errors, commonly found in the image classi ﬁcations, will\\ncause some level of inaccuracy of the mangrove area statistics and\\ndistributions. Particularly, the 1977 land use maps were derived\\nfrom the MSS images with a spatial resolution of 80 m and four\\nspectral bands. Classifying the MSS images likely resulted in a\\n“lower quality ”classi ﬁcation product as compared with those\\nderived from the TM/ETM þscenes, which have seven spectral\\nbands with a 30-m resolution. We need to recognize the dif ﬁculties\\nin obtaining consistent satellite data for a long-term time series\\ninvestigations. In the current work, we had a time span of about 33\\nyears (1977 e2010) and the TM/ETM þimages did not cover the\\nentire time interval. Thus, we had to use the lower-quality MSS\\nimages to help ﬁll in the time span in order to better detect the\\ntrends of mangrove coverage change. Nonetheless, it should be\\nnoted that there were not many mangroves in the 1970 ’s in this\\narea to classify, and we believe that our MSS classi ﬁcation\\nadequately captured the distribution patterns of the mangroveforests that existed in the area for the purposes of the investigation.\\nThe fragmentation model used in the analysis is based on the P\\nff\\nvalue (connectivity) and the P f(forest area density). The outcomes\\n(fragmentation maps) derived from the model will be highly related\\nto the connectivity of pixels, which is closely dependent upon the\\naccuracy of the classi ﬁcations. Furthermore, the fragmentation\\nmodel is scale-dependent and threshold-dependent ( Riitters et al.,\\n2000 ), which implies that a proper analytical scale and threshold\\nshould be cautiously speci ﬁed after an intensive assessment of the\\nproperties of the speci ﬁc study case coupled with the percolation\\ntheory. In addition, the current analysis was unable to separate the\\nyounger mangrove stands from the mature stands, and the dense\\nTable 1\\nChanges in bird species and population sizes at Gaoqiao site, which were adapted from Wu (2009) coupled with the daily records of the reserve.\\nYear Number of bird\\nspeciesNumber of birds Population 1 Population 2 Population 3\\n2005 7 169\\n2008 9 2312009 17 475 Little Egret ( Egretta rzetta ) 208 Ringed Plover ( Charadrius.dubius )5 9\\n2010 19 675 Little Egret (Egretta garzetta) 273 Black-headed Gull ( Larus ridibundus ) 102 Green-winged Teal\\n(Anas crecca )5 9M.S.

Thus there is some un-\\ncertainty regarding the ecological implications for species depen-\\ndent up high-quality habitats situated in the interior regions of\\nmangrove patches. In the near future, we should address all above-\\nmentioned concerns by pursuing more accurate support datasets.\\n6. Conclusions\\nThis work has successfully characterized the spatio-temporal\\nchanges in mangrove distribution and fragmentation patterns\\nthrough interpreting multi-temporal Landsat observations and\\nimplementing a fragmentation model in the Zhanjiang National\\nMangrove Forests Natural Reserve. The socio-economic drivers\\nresponsible for the observed changes were also examined. Partic-\\nularly, the linkages between mangrove fragmentation and biodi-\\nversity conservation (mainly birds) were highlighted to emphasize\\nthe signi ﬁcance of expanding the distribution of mangroves, miti-\\ngating the fragmentation of mangroves via afforestation, and con-\\nservation and education programs. We believe that the derived\\nfragmentation patterns and trends will help develop strategic plans\\non sustainable management important to mangrove and biodi-\\nversity conservation.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThis work was jointly funded by the special fund project for the\\nscienti ﬁc research of the forestry public welfare industry (No.\\n201304208) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China\\n(Grant No: 31270587, 30972297).

Thus, understanding the inherent con-ﬂicts between conservation/restoration and land-use demands is fundamental for mangrove management. To\\npredict how land-use changes will drive the spatiotemporal patterns of mangrove habitats, a novel integrated\\nframework coupling MaxEnt and Dyna-CLUE modeling was proposed. The coupled model can identify suitable\\nmangrove afforestation habitats and predict the impact of land-use change on potential mangrove habitats. Inthis study, the model was used to predict the mangrove habitat change in 2030 in the province with the most\\nmangrove forests in China. The potential suitable habitat of 14 mangrove species under three coastal land-use\\nscenarios were mapped using the coupled model. Under the current trend scenario, only 41.2% of the existingwetland would be retained, whereas the potential distribution area of all the mangrove species will decrease\\nby an average of 30%. Under the sustainable development and ecological protection scenarios, the mangrove hab-\\nitat could be increased by 11% to 61%, depending on the species. Different mangrove species showed varied sen-sitivity to the improved land-use policies, with several species being harder to restore than others, even underaggressive protection and restoration policies. The combined use of both MaxEnt and Dyna-CLUE models proved\\ncomplementary and offered insights into the impacts of different land-use policies on the spatiotemporal change\\nof mangrove habitats.\\n©2 0 2 1E l s e v i e rB .

Introduction\\nMangrove ecosystems are distributed along the coasts in tropical\\nand subtropical regions between latitudes of approximately 30° N and\\n30° S ( Giri et al., 2011 ) and provide valuable ecosystem services by\\nsupporting coastal ﬁsheries ( Zhang et al., 2019 ) while yielding commer-\\ncial forest products ( Blasco et al., 1996 ). They also provide coastal pro-\\ntection by regulating ﬂooding, erosion, siltation, and tidal surges\\n(Alongi, 2008 ;Giri et al., 2011 ), while storing and sequestering rela-\\ntively large quantities of carbon ( Sasmito et al., 2019 ). Additionally, mil-\\nlions of coastal residents live around mangrove ecosystems and draw\\nheavily from their goods and services ( Atkinson et al., 2016 ;Gevana\\net al., 2015 ).\\nThe proximity of mangroves to coastal population centers leads to\\nmassive degradation and loss. In the last two decades of the 20th cen-\\ntury, approximately 35% of mangroves disappeared ( Valiela et al.,\\n2001 ), with only 15.2 million hectares of mangroves remaining world-\\nwide ( Spalding et al., 2010 ). Furthermore, mangroves are on the verge\\nof extinction in 26 out of the 120 countries with mangroves ( FAO,\\n2007 ), owing to land use and land cover (LULC) changes from small-\\nscale tree harvesting for ﬁrewood ( Malik et al., 2017 )t oi n d u s t r i a l -\\nscale logging for timber ( Sillanpaa et al., 2017 ) and clear-cutting for\\naquaculture ponds ( Richards and Friess, 2016 ;Thomas et al., 2017 ;Jia\\net al., 2018 ) that replaced mangrove areas worldwide. In addition, man-\\ngrove clearance for urban expansion and development of coastal infra-\\nstructure has added to the losses, particularly in places where coastal\\npopulations are rapidly expanding ( Worthington and Spalding, 2018 ).\\nFor example, a massive loss of mangrove forests, approximately 1.9 mil-\\nlion hectares, has been reported in Asia since 1980 ( Malik et al., 2017 ).\\nIn China, a total of 12,924 ha of mangrove forests have disappeared\\nbetween 1980 and 2000 ( Jia et al., 2018 ). Reclamation was the main\\ncause of mangrove forest loss, with 97.6% being used to build aquacul-\\nture ponds ( Paulson Institute, 2020 ). The increase in urban construction\\nland and decrease in mangrove forests also showed a signi ﬁcant corre-\\nlation ( Tuholskea et al., 2017 ). In recent years, mangrove conservation\\nand restoration efforts in China have faced problems, such as insuf ﬁcient\\neffectiveness and low survival rates ( Peng et al., 2016 ). The reasons for\\nthis include urbanization and reclamation of suitable mangrove habitats\\nand improper site selection of restoration projects ( Fan and Wang,\\n2017 ;Jia et al., 2018 ), with only 57% of the replanted mangroves\\nbeing successfully restored nationwide ( Chen et al., 2009 ). In the Na-\\ntional Action Plan for Mangrove Conservation and Restoration\\n(2020 –2025), the Chinese government planned to restore 18,800 ha\\nof mangroves by 2025 ( MNR and NFGA, 2020 ). Moreover, it is now ac-\\nknowledged that improved mangrove ecosystem management, by\\npreventing further land-use change and promoting regeneration efforts,\\ni.e., restoration, rehabilitation, and afforestation, is fundamental for\\nmangrove conservation ( Peng et al., 2016 ;Jia et al., 2018 ;Sasmito\\net al., 2019 ). Thus, balancing the economic growth needs of land and\\nmangrove habitat conservation/restoration is a signi ﬁcant challenge,\\nand knowledge on the spatial distribution of mangrove habitat changes\\ndriven by land-use pressure, the change rates, and the effect of different\\npolicies can provide an important scienti ﬁc basis for the formulation of\\nmanagement strategies.\\nIdeally, mangroves can be afforested in theoretically suitable areas.\\nHowever, owing to coastal socioeconomic development, not all of\\nthese areas are available for mangrove afforestation, such as urban\\nand aquaculture areas. Several tools can be used to assess this issue.\\nSuitable habitats for mangroves can be mapped using species distribu-\\ntion models (SDMs) ( Johnson et al., 2006 ;Phillips et al., 2017 ). SDMs\\ncan analyze the relationship between species distribution data and en-\\nvironmental factors through statistical algorithms to predict the distri-\\nbution probability of related species ( Kulhanek et al., 2011 ;Li et al.,\\n2019 ), and have been successfully used to map suitable areas of man-\\ngroves ( Charrua et al., 2020 ;Hu et al., 2020a ), with the maximum en-\\ntropy model (MaxEnt) showing the best performance. On the otherhand, land-use change models are often used to simulate land-use dy-\\nnamics and support political decisions on land-use management\\n(Tesfaw et al., 2018 ;Peng et al., 2020 ). Land-use change models can de-\\ntermine where (location of change) and at what rate land-use changes\\nare likely to occur (quantity of change) ( Trisurat et al., 2010 ;\\nSakayarote and Shrestha, 2019 ). However, these two model types are\\nusually used independently, i.e., either considering natural suitability(Charrua et al., 2020 ;Hu et al., 2020b ) or land-use pressures ( Sardar\\nand Samadder, 2021 ), and have seldom been combined to study the\\nspatiotemporal dynamics of mangrove habitats. Coupling SDMs and\\nland-use change models can address how suitable habitats for man-\\ngroves interact with future land-use changes and help make sugges-\\ntions for appropriate land-use and mangrove management policies.\\nTo predict the con ﬂict between mangrove habitat and land use, and\\nexplore how land-use changes will drive the spatiotemporal patterns\\nof mangrove habitats, this study combined an SDM and land-use change\\nmodel focusing on Guangdong Province. Guangdong has the largest\\nmangrove distribution area among China's coastal provinces ( Dan\\net al., 2016 ), and is the most economically developed coastal regions in\\nthe nation, facing huge development pressures. We aimed to (1) develop\\nan integrated framework to assess mangrove habitat dynamics under\\nland-use pressures across space and time; (2) identify suitable afforesta-\\ntion habitats for different mangrove species; (3) simulate land-use and\\nmangrove potential habitat changes until 2030 under three policy sce-\\nnarios; and (4) evaluate the impacts of different land-use policies to pro-\\nvide information for mangrove protection and restoration management.\\n2. Methods2.1. Study area\\nGuangdong Province is located at 20° 13 ′N–25° 31 ′N and 109° 39 ′\\nE\\n−117° 19 ′E, with the Tropic of Cancer running through the province\\n(Liao and Zhang, 2014 ), and its coastline (8500 km) covers the northern\\ntropical and southern subtropical temperature zones. The Gross Domestic\\nProduct (GDP) of Guangdong ranks ﬁrst nationwide with over 115 mil-\\nlion people ( NBSC, 2020 ), and its GDP growth rate was 6.2% in 2019, mak-\\ning it one of the fastest economically growing regions worldwide ( Lv\\net al., 2012 ). According to the Second National Wetland Resources Survey,\\n57.3% of China's mangroves are scattered along the coastline of Guang-\\ndong ( Fig. 1 ), with an area of 12,040 ha ( Dan et al., 2016 ;Yang et al.,\\n2018 ;Wu et al., 2011 ). There are 14 native true mangrove species, with\\nAvicennia marina ,Aegiceras corniculatum ,Sonneratia caseolaris , and\\nKandelia obovata being the most common species ( Yang et al., 2018 ).\\n2.2. Methodology framework\\nAn integrated framework was proposed to identify suitable man-\\ngrove afforestation habitats and predict the impact of future land-usechange on mangrove habitats based on MaxEnt and Dyna-CLUE model-\\ning ( Fig. 2 ). The proposed approach consists of four steps: (1) dataset\\ncollection and processing, including mangrove presence, environmen-\\ntal, LULC, and socioeconomic data; (2) predicting the potential suitabil-\\nity of mangrove distribution by MaxEnt modeling using the presence\\ndata and environmental variables; (3) simulating the 2030 land-use\\nchange under three scenarios through Dyna-CLUE modeling;\\n(4) predicting the spatial change of mangrove habitat under the con-\\nstraints of land-use pattern by deducting all the arti ﬁcial land-use\\ntypes from the theoretically suitable area of mangroves ( Bastin et al.,\\n2019 ;Vessella and Schirone, 2013 ).\\n2.3. MaxEnt modeling2.3.1. Species occurrence records\\nESRI World Imagery 2018 (resolution 2.5 m) was used to visually in-\\nterpret the mangrove forest patches along the coast. The patches inY. Wang, B. Chao, P. Dong et al. Science of the Total Environment 788 (2021) 147914\\n2Zhanjiang, the Pearl River Estuary, and Shantou were then checked\\nthrough on-site investigations in 2018 –2019. Reconnaissance and sam-\\npling surveys were conducted and combined with historical records\\nfrom the literature review ( Chen et al., 2017 ;Li et al., 2016 ;Lin et al.,\\n2006 ) to determine the distribution of mangrove species. Thereafter,\\n196 patches ( Fig. 1 ) were resampled into points using the Fishnetmethod in ArcGIS Pro 2.6.2, with a sampling resolution of 100 m. Finally,\\n7777 occurrence points were obtained to generate the species presence\\ndataset. As these mangroves comprised temperature-limited species\\n(Lin and Fu, 1995 ;Wu et al., 2018 ), we divided the 14 species into\\nseven groups according to their distribution margin and cold tolerance\\n(Table 1 ). According to the occurrence of each group, the sampling\\nFig. 1. Study area and mangrove occurrence records.\\nFig. 2. Methodological framework.

Environmental variables\\nTemperature, salinity, substrate, and distance from the coastline are\\nimportant factors affecting the growth and distribution of mangroves\\n(Peng et al., 2016 ). In this study, the original environmental dataset\\ncontained 40 variables related to mangrove distribution, including bio-\\nclimatic, terrain, substrate, sea surface temperature (SST), and sea sur-\\nface salinity (SSS) variables. As strong variable collinearity may cause\\nmisinterpretation of the MaxEnt model owing to the high correlation\\nlevel among variables ( Jayasinghe and Kumara, 2019 ), a correlation\\nanalysis of 40 environmental variables was performed. The variables\\nwith high correlation (Pearson correlation coef ﬁcient |r| ≥0.8) were re-\\nmoved, and the less correlated variables were retained for the MaxEnt\\nmodel ( Chakraborty et al., 2016 ;Wei et al., 2018 ;Jayasinghe and\\nKumara, 2019 ). The resultant variable set contained 20 predictors\\n(Table 2 ). All the environmental variable layers were interpolated into\\nthe coastal area with a 10 km buffer zone along the coastline and stan-\\ndardized into the same 1 km grids. Finally, these layers were converted\\nto ASCII format for further processing in MaxEnt.\\n2.3.3. Model settings and evaluation\\nSuitable habitats for mangroves in Guangdong Province were pre-\\ndicted using MaxEnt 3.4.1 ( Phillips et al., 2017 ). MaxEnt estimates the\\nhabitat suitability of targeted species by ﬁnding the maximum entropy\\nof the species distribution based on input presence data and environ-\\nmental variables ( Phillips et al., 2006 ). In the present study, 75% of the\\npresence data was randomly selected as training data, while the re-\\nmaining 25% was used as testing data. The recommended default pa-\\nrameters for the convergence threshold (10 –5), maximum number of\\niterations (500), maximum number of background points (10,000),\\nand bootstrap resampling method were used. The averaged result\\nfrom 10 replications was taken as the ﬁnal output.\\nModel performance was evaluated based on the area under the\\ncurve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The\\nAUC was used to evaluate the model ef ﬁcacy, with an AUC closer to 1 in-\\ndicating better performance ( Wang et al., 2020a ). The permutation im-\\nportance of the variables was evaluated using the model and\\ndetermined by randomly permuting the values of each variable\\namong the training points and measuring the resulting decrease in the\\ntraining AUC.\\n2.4. Dyna-CLUE model simulation\\n2.4.1. Model process and data\\nThe Dyna-CLUE model can simulate and predict the spatial layout of\\nland use through quantitative analysis and summarization of the inter-\\nactions among different land covers, and natural, policy, and social fac-\\ntors ( Verburg and Overmars, 2009 ). The model includes two parts: anon-spatial demand module for predicting future land use demand\\nand a space allocation module for calculating land use plans. The\\nDyna-CLUE model calculates the distribution probability of a certain\\nLULC type in a certain area through the spatial module. Then multiple it-\\nerations in the non-spatial module are performed according to the ini-\\ntial land use data, land use scenarios, time series, and other\\nparameters, and ﬁnally the land use pattern of the forecast year is calcu-\\nlated and determined through the iteration result ( Peng et al., 2020 ).\\nThe change rate of each LULC type was calculated using LULC data for\\n2015 and 2020 ( http://www.resdc.cn/ ). In the intertidal zone, the distri-\\nbution dataset of the national wetland and coastal aquaculture ponds\\n(http://gre.geodata.cn ) was used to complete the coastal LULC map.\\nThus, the ﬁnal map was reclassi ﬁed into eight LULC types: cultivated\\nland, grassland, woodland, water, wetland, bare land, urban and indus-\\ntrial land, and aquaculture.\\nLand-use changes are related to various biophysical and socioeco-\\nnomic drivers ( Peng et al., 2020 ). Thus, ﬁve topographic and ﬁve socio-\\neconomic indices were input into the model as driving factors ( Table 3 ).\\nConsidering the prediction accuracy and operation limit of the Dyna-\\nCLUE model, all data were resampled to 250 m ( Gong et al., 2018 ).\\n2.4.2. Setting of land-use scenarios\\nThree scenarios were developed for 2030 according to the current\\nland-use change from 2015 to 2020. The current trend scenario (CTS)\\nwas based on the assumption that the tendency of land-use change in\\nthe past ﬁve years was maintained. The sustainable development sce-\\nnario (SDS) considered the maintenance and restoration of natural eco-\\nsystems while promoting urbanization and economic development.\\nAquaculture was the main reason for the destruction of mangroves\\n(Fan and Wang, 2017 ;Paulson Institute, 2020 ), and due to unsustain-\\nable aquaculture development, approximately 30% of aquaculture\\nponds are currently abandoned and unused ( Paulson Institute, 2020 ).\\nBased on these data, in SDS, the change rate of arti ﬁcial land types was\\nassumed to be reduced by 50%, whereas 50% of the aquaculture area lo-\\ncated at 0 –6 m water depth would be restored to wetland. The ecolog-\\nical protection scenario (EPS) considered aggressive ecological\\nprotection and restoration policy, completely stopping the transfer\\nfrom natural to arti ﬁcial land types. In this scenario, the urban and in-\\ndustrial land was assumed to stop expanding. The decreasing trend of\\nnatural land types was assumed to be reversed, the increasing trend\\nwould be half of the historical decreasing rate. Moreover, 100% of the\\naquaculture area located at a water depth of 0 –6 m would be restored\\nto wetlands. The spatial land-use changes of these scenarios were sim-\\nulated with the Dyna-CLUE model (version 2.0) ( Verburg et al., 2002 ;\\nOvermars et al., 2007 ) based on the 10 driving factors.\\n2.4.3. Model evaluation\\nTheﬁtness of driving factors and land conversion were tested using\\nthe ROC method ( Swets, 1988 ;Pontius et al., 2008 ).

If the two phases of land-use type maps are identical, the kappa\\nvalue is 1, whereas if the kappa value is less than 0.4, the simulation ef-\\nfect is considered poor ( Liao et al., 2019 ).\\n2.5. Habitat change calculation\\nFirst, for each species group, a binary map was generated based on\\nhabitat suitability, with a suitability threshold of 0.5 ( Wang et al.,\\n2020b ). Grids with a value of 1 indicated that the area was a potential\\nhabitat for mangroves, meanwhile grids with a value of 0 were consid-\\nered to have inadequate environmental conditions for mangrove\\ngrowth. Then, the arti ﬁcial land types (cultivated land, urban and indus-\\ntrial land, and aquaculture) in current and future scenarios were\\nregarded as areas that were not available for afforestation and were ex-\\ncluded from the binary maps. The potential restorable habitats wereﬁnally identi ﬁed by deducting the arti ﬁcial lands and unsuitable habi-\\ntats, and the changes in trends were analyzed based on these results.\\n3. Results\\n3.1. Theoretical distribution of mangrove habitats\\nIn the MaxEnt modeling, the averaged AUC values of the seven spe-\\ncies groups were between 0.89 and 0.99, indicating that the model per-\\nformed well in identifying the mangrove habitat distribution.\\nFurthermore, the potential distribution ranges varied signi ﬁcantly\\namong groups. G1 and G6 had the widest and narrowest distribution,\\nwith an area of 160,513 and 9663 ha, respectively. Stacking the distribu-\\ntions of all groups, species richness decreased with increasing latitude\\n(Fig. 3 ), and the predicted suitable range for most mangrove species\\nwas between 20.5° N and 22.5° N.\\nBy analyzing the environmental variable permutation importance,\\nwe found that the importance of environmental drivers also varied\\namong groups. Nevertheless, variables from types of precipitation, sa-\\nlinity, and sea surface temperature mostly determined the distribution\\nof mangroves in Guangdong Province. We screened and listed the top\\nthree important variables for each group in Table 4 . The annual precip-\\nitation, SST in the coldest season, and salinity range showed important\\ncontributions in most groups. These environmental variables were\\nused to describe the multidimensional niche of each group ( Fig. 4 ),\\nand indicated that the niches for G1 and G4 were wider than those of\\nother groups, whereas the niches for G6 and G7 were the narrowest,Table 2\\nList of environment variables used in MaxEnt modeling.\\nData types Environmental variables Units Data sources\\nBioclimatic Annual mean temperature °C WorldClim version 2.1 ( www.worldclim.org )\\nMean diurnal range °CIsothermality %Range of annual temperature variation °C\\nMean temperature of wettest quarter °C\\nAnnual precipitation mmPrecipitation seasonality %Precipitation of warmest quarter mmPrecipitation of coldest quarter mm\\nTopographic Euclidean distance to the coast M The Paci ﬁc Islands Ocean Observing System's Distance to Nearest Coastline ( http://oos.soest.\\nhawaii.edu/thredds/ncss/dist2coast_1deg_ocean/dataset.html )\\nCompound Topographic Index – Calculated by ArcGIS Pro 2.6.2 according to elevation data\\nElevation – ETOPO1 bathymetry data from NOAA https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/global.html\\nLocal deviation from global – Calculated by ArcGIS Pro 2.6.2 according to elevation data\\nSubstrate Substrate type – 2018 AHO S57 map\\nSea surface salinity (SSS) Annual SSS mean ‰ Bio-ORACLE dataset\\n(www.bio-oracle.org )\\nAnnual SSS range ‰\\nSea surface temperature (SST) Mean SST of coldest quarter °C Derived from NASA MODIS-Aqua Level-3( http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov )\\nMonthly SST range\\nAnnual SST mean\\nAnnual SST range\\nTable 3Driving factors used in Dyna-CLUE modeling.\\nData types Driving factors Units Data sources\\nTopographic Elevation m National Catalogue Service for Geographic Information ( http://mulu.tianditu.gov.cn/ )\\nSlope °Aspect –\\nSoil erosion – Resource and Environment Science and Data Center ( http://www.resdc.cn/ )\\nSoil texture –\\nSocioeconomic Distance to rivers m National Catalogue Service for Geographic Information ( http://mulu.tianditu.gov.cn/ )\\nDistance to roads mDistance to settlements mGDP Yuan km\\n2y−1Resource and Environment Science and Data Center ( http://www.resdc.cn/ )\\nPopulation Person km−2y−1Y.

Under CTS, aquaculture and\\nurban/industrial land were the main net in ﬂow land types, and the nat-\\nural land types were mainly out ﬂow. However, under the alternative\\nland-use policies, land-use transfer patterns showed great changes.For example, under SDS, the urbanization process would take up a\\nlarge amount of cultivated land, whereas cultivated land and aquacul-\\ntural areas would be returned to natural land types. Under EPS, a large\\nnumber of aquacultural areas would be restored to wetlands, whereas\\nthe cultivated areas would be returned to grassland, woodland, and\\nwater ( Fig. 5 ).\\nCurrently, the scattered mangrove patches are mainly distributed as\\nwetlands, water, and woodland. Under CTS, these land-use types were\\nall reduced, especially the wetland, with a decline so fast that, at this\\nrate, only 41.2% of the existing wetlands would remain by 2030\\n(Table 6 ). Under SDS, the woodland and water areas were maintained\\nat the level they were in 2020, and the area of wetland increased signif-\\nicantly. Meanwhile, under EPS, woodland and water areas were re-\\nstored to those of 2015, and the wetland area was restored to over\\nthree times that in 2015 ( Fig. 6 ).\\nFig. 3.

The impacts of land-use change on mangrove habitats\\nThe suitable areas estimated using MaxEnt described the environ-\\nmental limits for the presence of mangrove species. Next, the current\\nand future anthropogenic factors (urbanization, restoration, etc.) were\\nimposed onto the theoretically suitable areas to predict the actual affor-\\nestation extent of mangrove forests ( Table 7 ). All arti ﬁcial land types\\n(cultivated land, urban and industrial land, and aquaculture) were\\ndeducted from the theoretically suitable mangrove areas, with G1 and\\nG6 showing the largest and smallest distribution range, respectively,\\nunder all current and future scenarios. Driven by the simulated land-\\nuse pattern in 2030, the actual available habitat ranges of all groups\\nwere predicted to decline signi ﬁcantly under CTS, with an obvious frag-\\nmentation of the mangrove forest patches. In contrast, the mangrove\\ndistribution range increased signi ﬁcantly under SDS and EPS, maintain-\\ning and promoting the integrity of habitat patches ( Fig. 7 ).According to the results, if the current land-use policy is maintained\\nuntil 2030, the potential distribution area of all mangrove species will\\ndecrease by an average of approximately 30%. However, under the\\nother two scenarios, different mangrove species showed varied sensi-\\ntivity to conservation and restoration policies. The mangrove distribu-\\ntion area could be increased by 11% –61% depending on the different\\nscenarios and species groups. Among all groups, G6 showed the least\\noptimistic scenario, with dif ﬁculties to achieve effective growth even\\nunder aggressive protection and restoration scenarios ( Fig. 8 ).\\n4. Discussion\\n4.1. Mangrove conservation and restoration implications\\nOur study estimated the potential suitable habitat of 14 mangrove\\nspecies in the Guangdong Province. According to the Red List of Threat-\\nened Species of China, A. speciosum andA. ebracteatus in G6 are classi ﬁed\\nas endangered, whereas B. sexangula andS. caseolaris in G6 and G7, re-\\nspectively, are classi ﬁed as near-threatened ( Wang et al., 2020b ).\\nThese two groups also showed the narrowest distribution ranges and\\necological niches according to the modeled results, which may be re-\\nlated to physiological characteristics ( Chen et al., 2010 ). For example,\\nA. ebracteatus has a poor tolerance to water and strong light, and only\\ngrows in the inner edge of mangrove forests, with a restricted distribu-\\ntion, mostly in the upper intertidal zones ( Huang et al., 2020 ). Mean-\\nwhile, their limited environmental adaptability makes them more\\nsusceptible to external pressures, accelerating their degradation. For in-\\nstance, aquaculture development was the most important reason for\\nthe loss of A. speciosum ,B. sexangula, and S. caseolaris in their original\\ndistribution sites in the 1990s ( Mao, 2011 ). Therefore, we recommend\\nthat these species should be protected as a priority, not only by\\nFig. 4.

In contrast, G6 and G7\\nspecies were distributed in a narrow niche and only suitable for\\nthe southernmost part of the study area. Latitude limitation suggests\\nthat owing to tolerance to low temperatures, the success rate of res-\\ntoration may be reduced by transplanting species in G6 northward.\\nIn the Pearl River Estuary, most of the introduced species of G6\\ndied after the extremely cold winter of 2008, whereas the\\nnative species K. obovata ,A. corniculatum ,a n d A. marina (G1) sur-\\nvived ( Chen et al., 2012 ). In Shantou, after yea rs of afforestation\\npractice, most of the existing mangrove species belong to G1\\n(Peng et al., 2015 ).\\nFurthermore, our results support site selection for mangrove conser-\\nvation and restoration. Areas with the richest mangrove species, such as\\neast Zhanjiang and Yangjiang, where 12 species could coexist, should be\\nconsidered a conservation priority to improve the effectiveness of pro-\\ntection. In addition, the MaxEnt model errors of commission,\\ni.e., regions with high habitat suitability where the species is not cur-\\nrently present, can be considered as candidate sites for mangrove resto-\\nration ( Bittner et al., 2020 ).Table 6\\nAreas of land use and land cover types in 2015, 2020, and three scenarios of 2030 (ha).\\nLand-use type 2015 2020 2030\\nCTS SDS EPS\\nCultivated land 920,856 896,788 836,770 850,521 836,770\\nGrassland 118,625 121,869 126,756 122,046 139,392\\nWoodland 907,063 892,319 849,866 893,616 907,025\\nWater 240,756 221,919 185,147 222,241 240,518\\nWetland 41,206 26,938 11,099 86,784 146,631\\nBare land 10,694 10,175 9056 10,190 19,363\\nUrban and industrial land 384,375 424,425 510,971 468,880 424,425Aquaculture 247,125 276,269 341,035 216,422 156,575\\nTotal 2, 870,700 2,870,700 2,870, 700 2,870,700 2,870,700\\nFig. 6.

Drivers of mangrove habitat change and the effect of land-use policies\\nSimulation of land-use from 2020 to 2030 under the three scenarios\\ndemonstrated that land-use change was the crucial driver of mangrove\\nhabitat shrinkage. Under CTS, the continuous expansion of aquaculture,\\nas well as urban and industrial land, led to a signi ﬁcant decrease in man-\\ngrove habitat. We found that the existing mangrove patches are close tothe edge of aquaculture ponds and thus easily affected by aquaculture\\nactivities, resulting in habitat degradation or direct occupation by aqua-\\nculture activities.

Science of the Total Environment 788 (2021) 147914\\n9mangroves in Hainan Province showed that the aquaculture area in-\\ncreased in 1966 –2009, resulting in mangrove fragmentation and reduc-\\ntion ( Herbeck et al., 2020 ). In addition, uncontrolled urban expansion is\\nthe most important threat for mangroves in developing countries and\\nregions. Urbanization has destroyed more than 30% of the Brazilian\\nsoutheast mangrove forests ( Moschetto et al., 2020 ). In Honduras,\\n19.1% of mangroves have been converted to urban areas since 1985(Tuholskea et al., 2017 ). In Guangdong Province, there was a correlation\\nbetween the increase in urban regions and the loss of mangrove forests,\\nwhich became more apparent with time ( Ai et al., 2020 ). Furthermore,\\nland-use change not only directly affects the coastal estuarine area,\\nbut also disturbs total direct runoff regimes, shifts upstream catchment\\nareas, and affects freshwater inputs to mangroves ( Bhattachan et al.,\\n2018 ;Feng et al., 2020 ;Maﬁ-Gholami et al., 2020b ).\\nIn this study, land-use changes not only caused suitable habitats for\\nmangroves to be occupied, but also affected the protection of man-\\ngroves. Under CTS, mangrove patches not only showed fragmentation,\\nbut also tended to retreat seawards because of the expansion of arti ﬁcial\\nland. Therefore, the construction of mangrove nature reserves faces a di-\\nlemma to a certain extent. Although the government planned to in-\\ncrease the protection rate of mangrove habitats by setting or\\nexpanding nature reserves, it has been dif ﬁcult to extend the reserves\\nto arti ﬁcial land. In Guangdong Province, although the mangrove con-\\nservation rate of mangrove nature reserves increased from the 1980s\\nto the 2010s, most mangroves have been isolated by aquaculture\\nponds and buildings from terrestrial habitats ( Peng et al., 2016 ). There-\\nfore, nature reserves had no choice but to extend their boundaries to\\nlow intertidal zones where mangroves were virtually impossible to\\ngrow. This reduced the actual protection rate of suitable mangrove hab-\\nitats after 2000 ( Peng et al., 2016 ). Hence, owing to the in ﬂuence of\\nland-use patterns, there may even be a loss of mangrove habitat under\\nthe virtual increase in nature reserves.\\nOur results also demonstrated that changes in land-use policies can\\nsigniﬁcantly enhance the potential mangrove survival space. Even if the\\nmost radical protection and restoration strategy (EPS) is not adopted,\\nthe mangrove habitat degradation trend under SDS could be decreased\\nsubstantially or even reversed. Therefore, based on scienti ﬁc demon-\\nstration and after the inquiry of stakeholders, feasible land-use policies\\nshould be put forward to promote the restoration of mangroves. Possi-\\nble resistance may come from stakeholders like aquaculture owners.The success rate of coastal ﬁshpond farming in southern China is only\\nabout 35%, and 30% of aquaculture ponds are currently abandoned\\n(Paulson Institute, 2020 ). Thus, it would be possible to return some\\naquacultural land to wetland, including abandoned aquaculture ponds\\nand some of the ponds that cause the most serious disturbance to man-\\ngroves, to minimize the impact on the livelihood of local communities.\\nAppropriate ecological compensation also should be considered in\\nlocal mangrove conservation and restoration action plans. Moreover,\\nour prediction results indicated that the G6 species were the least sen-\\nsitive to the improved land-use policies. Thus, further conservation\\nstrategies are recommended to maintain and recover this group in addi-\\ntion to land-use policies.\\n4.3. Study uncertainty and improvement\\nPrevious studies on mangrove distribution used a single SDM to ex-\\nplain the in ﬂuence of natural environmental factors on current man-\\ngrove distribution ( Charrua et al., 2020 ;Hu et al., 2020a ), with climate\\nchange, storms, and erosion being used as driving factors by several dy-\\nnamic studies to evaluate past, or predict future, changes in mangrove\\ndistribution (\\nMaﬁ-Gholami et al., 2020a ;Cameron et al., 2021 ;Thakur\\net al., 2021 ). However, land use often plays a direct role in the change\\nin mangrove distribution. A study spanning 35 years showed that the\\nzones accessible to human activities are affected by land cover changes\\nsigniﬁcantly more than by natural drivers ( Quader et al., 2017 ).Hu et al.\\n(2020b) overlaid land-use patterns in mangrove-suitable areas to assessthe current restoration potential. However, few studies have applied the\\nquantitative prediction of land-use change with the simulation of man-\\ngrove distribution change in the future. This study proved that MaxEnt\\nand Dyna-CLUE models can be successfully coupled to ﬁnd available\\nmangrove habitats under different land-use policies. In addition to sta-\\ntistical veri ﬁcation, the modeled result was compared with the results of\\na traditional forestry ﬁeld survey as another kind of model validation. In\\nthe current scenario, the maximum potential habitat was estimated to\\nbe 34,531 ha, which is close to the 32,326 ha obtained through the for-\\nestry surveys ( He et al., 2006 ).\\nAlthough the method was effective, some improvements can still be\\nmade in future studies. For example, the availability of data limited the\\noperating resolution of the MaxEnt model. The deductive method was\\nused to couple the two models ( Bastin et al., 2019 ;Vessella and\\nSchirone, 2013 ) because the dataset resolution of the MaxEnt model\\nwas 1 km (the best resolution available in the World Bioclimatic Data-\\nbase), whereas the resolution of the land-use data was 250 m. There-\\nfore, the two models had to be trained separately at different\\nresolutions. This may have caused the mangrove habitat extent to be\\nover-estimated because the Maxent model could not identify environ-\\nmental heterogeneity within 1 km. The use of the deductive method\\nwith higher-resolution land use data could constrain the habitat extent\\nand compensate for this shortcoming to some extent. If the resolution of\\nmarine environmental data can be improved to match that of LULC data,\\nbetter model coupling pathways could be adopted. For instance, LULC\\ndata could be treated as one of the environmental variables in the\\nMaxEnt model and used directly as input drivers ( Wang et al., 2020a ).\\nIn this study, land-use patterns were adopted as crucial drivers to\\npredict the future changes of mangrove habitats. However, the actual\\nmangrove distribution can also be affected by other factors. The expan-\\nsion of mangrove forests takes at least ﬁve to seven years due to the af-\\nforestation cycle and survival rate ( Wodehouse and Rayment, 2019 ).\\nLong-term survivorship and stable mangrove stands may require\\nmore than 10 years ( Salmo et al., 2013 ;Azman et al., 2021 ). Hence, al-\\nthough the impact of land-use changes on mangrove potential habitats\\nhas been clearly revealed, actual changes in mangrove distribution may\\ntake a long time to manifest. In addition, this study only focused on the\\nspatial pattern change, whereas mangrove degradation drivers such as\\npollution, excavation, and cultivation within the mangrove forest were\\nnot fully considered.\\n5. Conclusion\\nPredicting the spatial extent of mangrove habitats under land-use\\npressure is one of the main challenges for mangrove restoration plan-\\nning and management. Mangrove forest distribution is not only related\\nto environmental conditions but is also affected by land development,\\nsuch as urbanization, cultivation, and aquaculture. Coupling SDM and\\nland-use change models, we proposed an integrated framework to as-\\nsess spatiotemporal changes in mangrove habitats. The land-use driving\\neffects on different mangrove species were also analyzed and compared\\nbased on the MaxEnt model and Dyna-CLUE model in Guangdong,\\nChina. Among three land-use scenarios, keeping the policy as CTS will\\ndecrease mangrove species by approximately 30%. Meanwhile, man-\\ngrove distribution areas could be increased by 11% –61% under SDS\\nand EPS, and the fragmentation of scattered habitat patches could also\\nbe improved. Detailed mangrove habitat distribution characteristics\\ncan be used to guide habitat restoration practices for each group. For ex-\\nample, species in G6, which were listed as endangered or near-\\nthreatened species, had dif ﬁculty achieving effective growth even\\nunder aggressive protection and restoration land-use scenarios, indicat-\\ning that additional conservation efforts should be made for these spe-\\ncies. The coupled use of MaxEnt and Dyna-CLUE models proved\\ncomplementary, offering insights into spatially explicit outcomes, and\\ncould quantify the impacts of different land-use policies on these\\noutcomes.Y.

Traditionally, multi-tides images were needed to remove the\\ninﬂuence of water; however, such images are often unavailable due to rainy climates and uncertain\\nlocal tidal conditions. Therefore, extracting mangrove forests from a single-tide imagery is of great\\nimportance. In this study, reﬂectance of red-edge bands in Sentinel-2 imagery were utilized to\\nestablish a new vegetation index that is sensitive to submerged mangrove forests. Speciﬁcally, red\\nand short-wave near infrared bands were used to build a linear baseline; the average reﬂectance\\nvalue of four red-edge bands above the baseline is deﬁned as the Mangrove Forest Index (MFI).\\nTo evaluate MFI, capabilities of detecting mangrove forests were quantitatively assessed between\\nMFI and four widely used vegetation indices (VIs). Additionally, the practical roles of MFI were\\nvalidated by applying it to three mangrove forest sites globally. Results showed that: (1) theoretically,\\nJensen–Shannon divergence demonstrated that a submerged mangrove forest and water pixels have\\nthe largest distance in MFI compared to other VIs. In addition, the boxplot showed that all submerged\\nmangrove forests could be separated from the water background in the MFI image. Furthermore, in\\nthe MFI image, to separate mangrove forests and water, the threshold is a constant that is equal to\\nzero. (2) Practically, after applying the MFI to three global sites, 99–102% of submerged mangrove\\nforests were successfully extracted by MFI. Although there are still some uncertainties and limitations,\\nthe MFI o \\x0bers great beneﬁts in accurately mapping mangrove forests as well as other coastal and\\naquatic vegetation worldwide.\\nKeywords: Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI); red-edge band; aquatic vegetation; tidal\\ncondition; vegetation index; coastal vegetation\\n1. Introduction\\nMangrove forest are highly productive ecosystems with signiﬁcant ecological and socio- economic\\nimportance in the world [ 1,2]. However, over the past century, these forests have declined at an\\nalarming rate that is more rapid than that of inland tropical forests [ 3]. Therefore, there is an emerging\\ndemand for conservation and restoration e \\x0borts in mangrove forests. Obtaining accurate information\\nRemote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043; doi:10.3390 /rs11172043 www.mdpi.com /journal /remotesensingRemote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 2 of 17\\nregarding the current and past acreage and condition of mangrove forests is essential for e \\x0ecient\\nmanagement of these ecosystems and for policy- and decision-making processes [4,5].\\nLocated in intertidal zones, mangrove forests are often inaccessible for traditional ﬁeld surveys.\\nFor decades, remote sensing has been widely used to monitor the distribution of mangrove forests, yet\\naccurate and timely interpretation of the relatively small patches has been rare, due to the lack of full\\nconsideration of tidal conditions [ 6–9]. Mangrove forests located near the shoreline are periodically\\nsubmerged by tides, especially in regions with high tide ﬂuctuations and lower mangrove shrubs [ 9,10].\\nIdeally, it is better to use images acquired during low tides; however, such data are di \\x0ecult to obtain,\\ndue to uncertainties of local instantaneous tidal conditions during predetermined times that satellites\\npass over [ 11,12]. For a long time, numerous studies have pointed out that tides may seriously\\ninﬂuence remote sensing results of mangrove forests, yet, solutions were not reported until the past\\ntwo years [ 10,13,14]. However, all these studies used multi-tides (multi-date) images; therefore, we\\nhave one concern: if multi-tides images are not available due to rainy climates and uncertain local tide\\nconditions, how could we accurately map mangrove forests by a single-date image?\\nOver the last two decades, remote sensing of submerged and emerged aquatic vegetation has\\nbeen widely studied [ 15,16]. Hyperspectral image with numerous narrow and contiguous bands is\\nreliable for studying aquatic vegetation and is able to detect the biophysical properties of vegetation\\ne\\x0eciently [ 16–19]. However, there is no freely available satellite hyperspectral data in recent years, and\\nairborne applications are exorbitantly expensive and only cover a very small spatial extent. Landsat\\nimages with moderate spatial resolution of 30–60 m have been widely used for mapping aquatic\\nvegetation [ 20–24]. Yet, Landsat only has one band in the spectral region of near infrared (760–900 nm),\\nwhich may become less sensitive as water depth increases [ 25]. The MODIS (Moderate Resolution\\nImaging Spectroradiometer) and AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) are publicly\\navailable with high spectral resolution but coarse spatial resolution (250–1100 m, respectively), making\\nthem unsuitable for mangrove detection [ 9]. In contrast, the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument\\n(MSI) sensor has a 10–20 m spatial resolution and ﬁve bands in near infrared region, which provides\\nopportunities to conduct quick, robust, and e \\x0ecient monitoring of submerged mangrove forests.\\nFor years, numerous methods were utilized to map mangrove forests as well as other aquatic\\nvegetation from remote sensing imagery, ranging from pixel to object-oriented approach, and manual\\nto unsupervised methods [ 9,14,26–28]. Recently, machine-learning algorithms such as random\\nforest, neural network, and support vector machine provide promising accuracy in mangrove forests\\nextraction [ 10,13,29]. As it is hard to locate representative training samples due to uncertain tidal\\nconditions, it is relatively hard to apply these methods to extract submerged mangrove forests from\\na single-date image. Vegetation indices (VIs), which are mathematically determined based on the\\nspectral characteristics of vegetation, have been proven e \\x0ecient in monitoring vegetation from\\nspace [ 30]. The Normalized Di \\x0berence Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the most commonly used index\\nin global vegetation studies (e.g., [ 30,31]). The Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and the Modiﬁed\\nNormalized Di \\x0berence Water Index (MNDWI) were proposed and widely used for mapping surface\\nwater [ 32–34]. Given that these indices are established based on di \\x0berences between two bands,\\nthey are insensitive to small variations of the reﬂectance of submerged mangrove forests and water\\nbackground [ 14]. Furthermore, it is hard to decide thresholds that distinguish submerged mangroves\\nand water. With more bands, several VIs were built based on a baseline theory, such as Maximum\\nChlorophyll Index (MCI; [ 35]), the Floating Algae Index (FAI; [ 36]), and the Floating Vegetation Index\\n(FVI; [ 17]). However, these indices were deﬁned to extract ﬂoating vegetation (above water surface)\\nfrom water, not submerged vegetation. Meanwhile, bands used to build MCI and FVI did not exist in\\nSentinel MSI image.\\nThus, the objective of this study is to develop a new vegetation index, called the Mangrove Forest\\nIndex (MFI), which is capable to map the distribution of mangroves based on a single date MSI image.\\nThen, we will compare MFI with other widely used VIs to validate MFI’s capabilities in detecting\\nsubmerged mangrove forests from water background. Additionally, MFI will be applied to three sitesRemote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 3 of 17\\nof typical mangrove forests worldwide; the practical roles of mapping mangrove forests during local\\nhigh-tide conditions will also be discussed.\\n2. Materials and Methods\\n2.1. Sentinel-2 Imagery\\nSentinel-2, a European Space Agency (ESA) land-monitoring mission, has two matching satellites\\nthat provide high-resolution optical imagery. Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B carry the MultiSpectral\\nInstrument (MSI) and were successfully launched in June 2015 and March 2017 respectively and\\nprovide important means to augment earth observation capabilities [ 37]. These satellites revisit the\\nsame location every 2 to 5 days. The MSI sensor o \\x0bers 13 spectral bands, with four bands at 10 m, six\\nbands at 20 m, and three bands at a 60 m spatial resolution (Table 1) and o \\x0bers a wide range of earth\\nobservation applications [38].\\nIn this study, Sentinel-2 MSI images were downloaded from European Space Agency Sentinels\\nScientiﬁc Data Hub; the images were preprocessed with geometric and radiometric corrections at\\nsub-pixel accuracy. Then, atmospheric correction (converting top-of-atmosphere reﬂectance into\\ntop-of-canopy reﬂectance) was performed by the tool of SEN2COR (version 2.05.05), which was\\navailable in the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) toolbox [ 39,40]. In order to standardize di \\x0berent\\nspatial resolutions of bands in MSI images, we excluded bands with a spatial resolution of 60 m (Band\\n1, Band 9, and Band 10). After atmospheric correction, all remaining bands were resampled to a pixel\\nsize of 20 m\\x0220 m.\\nTable 1.

Study Area\\nThe study area, Zhenzhu Harbor (21\\x0e280–21\\x0e420N and 108\\x0e000–108\\x0e200N), is located in Guangxi\\nProvince, China, in the southwest portion of mainland China and the north region of Tonkin Gulf\\n(Figure 1). In Zhenzhu Harbor, mangrove forests are mainly composed of four communities: Comm. A.\\nmarina, Comm. A. corniculatum, Comm. A. marina–A. corniculatum, and Comm. K. candel–A. corniculatum .\\nThe tides in the coast of Zhenzhu Harbor are diurnal, with an average tidal range of 2.24 m, and\\nmangrove forests here are primarily younger shrubs with an average height of less than 3 m [ 7].\\nTherefore, the Zhenzhu Harbor is a typical area for the study of submerged mangrove forests, due to a\\nlarge area of pioneer mangrove trees and shrubs that would be entirely submerged during high tides\\n(Figure 1A,B). Information of MSI images we selected are shown in Table 2.Remote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 4 of 17\\nAdditionally, a ﬁeld survey of Zhenzhu Harbor was conducted during April 2017, in which 408\\nground truth samples were collected including samples of mangrove forest, open water, and other\\nland cover.\\nFigure 1.

The\\nlocation of each sampling point was measured using a global positioning system (GPS), with an error\\nless than 1 m. The observations collected in the surveys contained 85 mangrove points and 81 water\\npoints. A vector ﬁle of ground survey points with the attributes of location (longitude and latitude),\\nland cover types, and photos was created with ArcGIS.\\nThe spectral curves of water, submerged mangrove forests, and emerged mangrove forests were\\nextracted from images. The workﬂow of discriminating these classes is shown in Figure 2. A reference\\nmap was built based on object-oriented methods and visual interpretation.\\nThe description of the object-oriented method can be found in Harayama and Jaquet [ 41]. The\\neCognition Developer 9.0, an image analysis program, was used to conduct object-oriented classiﬁcation.\\nVisual interpretation was performed to classify objects as either mangrove forests or water. To facilitateRemote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 5 of 17\\nvisual interpretation, a false color composite of MSI Bands 11 (centered 1610 nm), Band 8 (centered\\n842 nm), and Band 4 (centered 665 nm) was generated. This band combination that was deemed the\\nbest for detecting mangroves which appears dark green color [ 42]. Furthermore, in order to conduct the\\nadjustment in a robust manner, visual interpretation was performed by an experienced remote sensing\\nexpert who was familiar with this area. First, we identiﬁed mangrove forest and surrounding water\\nfrom the low-tide MSI image. Subsequently, a confusion matrix was generated using the independent\\nground-truth samples described in Section 2.2. With this matrix, we achieved an overall classiﬁcation\\naccuracy of 97% with a Kappa coe \\x0ecient of 0.92, which indicated excellent agreements between our\\nmapping results and ground-truth data. Therefore, mangrove forests identiﬁed with this method\\nwere assumed to cover entire area of local mangrove forests. Second, using the same techniques as\\nabove, mangrove forests were identiﬁed from the high-tide MSI image. Finally, the extent of the\\nsubmerged mangrove was determined by subtracting the high-tide from the low-tide mangrove forest\\nmap. Figure 3 shows the distributions of emerged mangrove forests and submerged mangrove forests\\nin the high-tidal MSI image.\\nFigure 2. Work ﬂow for identifying submerge mangrove forests.Remote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 6 of 17\\nFigure 3. Distribution of emerged and submerged mangrove forests in high-tide MSI image.\\n2.4. Theories\\nFigure 4 shows the ﬁeld measurements of spectral curves of the water, emerged vegetation,\\nand submerged vegetation, generated by Chen et al. (2018; Figure 4A) and Visser et al. (2015;\\nFigure 4B) [ 15,25]. As normal green plants, vegetation above the water surface showed high reﬂectance\\nin the spectral region of 770–890 nm. Waterbody is characterized by low reﬂectance in near infrared at\\n700 nm while emerged mangrove has a relatively high reﬂectance, which make them separable from\\neach other. However, when mangroves are submerged under water, the reﬂectance is largely reduced,\\ntherefore, it is di \\x0ecult to distinguish submerged vegetation from waterbody [ 15,25,43]. As measured,\\nwhen submerged vegetation are 43–51 cm below clear water, the NDVI value was close to zero, which\\nmeans no di \\x0berences were observed between the red band and NIR band [44].\\nHowever, by careful inspection of the spectral curves shown in Figure 4A,B, two reﬂectance\\npeaks ranging from approximately 690–740 nm and 810–830 nm were found, even for the curves of\\nvegetation located 40 cm below the water surface. These peaks result from the competing e \\x0bects\\nof the chlorophyll reﬂectance plateau and the absorption e \\x0bects of water located within submerged\\nvegetation and the surrounding water background. However, traditional multispectral satellite sensors\\ncould not capture these reﬂectance peaks. Fortunately, the MSI sensor has ﬁve channels that cover\\nthese regions. Figure 5 shows the typical spectral curves of water (WB), emerged mangrove forest\\n(EMF), and submerged mangrove forest (SMF) that are observed on the MSI image. As shown in\\nFigure 5, the emerged and shallow submerged mangrove forest pixels demonstrated a strong reﬂection\\nin the region of 660–900 nm, the absorption valleys appeared in bands 4 (centered wavelength 665 nm)\\nand 12 (centered 2160 nm). For the submerged mangrove forest (b) curves, a small reﬂectance peak\\nappeared in the 660–900 nm region; the absorption valley also appeared in bands 4 (centered 665 nm)\\nand 12 (centered 2160 nm). The reﬂectance of the water pixels shows a continuous decreasing tendency\\nbeginning with band 4 (central wavelength 665 nm). Therefore, comparing submerged curves to water\\ncurves, the higher reﬂectance in bands 5 (centered 705 nm), 6 (centered 740 nm), 7 (centered 783 nm),\\n8 (centered 842 nm), and 8A (centered 865 nm) could be used to distinguish submerged mangrove\\nforests from the water background.Remote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 7 of 17\\nFigure 4.

Existing Vegetation Indices\\nPreviously, NDVI (Equation 1), LSWI (Equation 2), and MNDWI (Equation 3) and FAI (Equation\\n4) were used in detecting vegetation from water bodies [33,34,45].\\nNDVI =\\x1aNIR\\x00\\x1aRed\\n\\x1aNIR+\\x1aRed(1)\\nLSWI =\\x1aNIR\\x00\\x1aSWIR\\n\\x1aNIR+\\x1aSWIR(2)\\nMNDWI =\\x1aGreen\\x00\\x1aSWIR\\n\\x1aGreen +\\x1aSWIR(3)\\nFAI=\\x08\\x1a860\\x00[\\x1a1240+(\\x1a660\\x00\\x1a1240)\\x02(1240\\x00860)/(1240\\x00660)]\\t(4)\\nwhere\\x1aGreen ,\\x1aRed,\\x1aNIR, and\\x1aSWIR are the reﬂectance of the green, red, NIR, and SWIR, respectively.\\nHowever, these indices are not suitable for discerning submerged vegetation from water bodies,\\nbecause there are no obvious reﬂectance di \\x0berences in bands green, red, and SWIR between submerged\\nvegetation and water bodies (Figures 4 and 5).Remote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 8 of 17\\n2.6. Formulation of MFI\\nFor this study, according to the analysis in Section 2.4, the absorption valleys in band 4 (centered\\n665 nm) and band 12 (centered 2190 nm) could be used to form a baseline (Figure 6). In order to\\nenhance the stability of di \\x0berences between submerged mangrove forests and the water background,\\nthe average value of reﬂectance of band 5 (centered 705 nm), band 6 (centered 740 nm), band 7 (centered\\n783 nm), and band 8A (centered 865 nm) above the baseline, is deﬁned as MFI. Band 8 was excluded\\nbecause Bands 7 (centered 783 nm) and 8A (centered 865 nm) covered most of its spectra, and its\\nspectral range overlaps with the water absorption region. The mathematical formulation is\\nMFI =h\\n(\\x1a\\x151\\x00\\x1aB\\x151)+(\\x1a\\x152\\x00\\x1aB\\x152)+(\\x1a\\x153\\x00\\x1aB\\x153)+(\\x1a\\x154\\x00\\x1aB\\x154\\x11\\n]/4 (5)\\n\\x1aB\\x15i=\\x1a2190+(\\x1a665\\x00\\x1a2190)\\x02(2190\\x00\\x15i)/(2190\\x00665) (6)\\nwhere the \\x1a\\x15is the reﬂectance of the band center of \\x15, and iranged from 1 to 4; \\x151,\\x152,\\x153,\\x154represent\\nthe center wavelengths at 705, 740, 783 and 865 nm, respectively. \\x1aB\\x15iis the baseline reﬂectance in\\n\\x15i.\\x1a665and\\x1a2190are the reﬂectance of band 4 (centered at 665 nm) and 12 (centered at 2190 nm),\\nrespectively. Pixels with an MFI value above 0 are recognized as mangrove forests.\\nFigure 6. Baseline theory of establishing Mangrove Forest Index (MFI), including reﬂectance of\\nsubmerged mangrove forest and water.\\n2.7. Quantitative Comparison between MFI and Other VIs\\nIn this study, Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD)—a measure of distance between a ﬁnite number\\nof distributions—was adopted to compare sensitivities of MFI and other VIs. The JSD ( D) quantiﬁes\\nthe di \\x0berence between two or more probability distributions. In this study, it was used to compare\\nthe di \\x0berences between submerged mangrove forests and water pixels in di \\x0berent VI images. The\\nDvalue, which was calculated in MATLAB, is deﬁned as follows: let p(1)\\x11(p(1)\\n1,p(1)\\n2,:::,p(1)\\nk)\\nand p(2)\\x11\\x12\\np(2)\\n1,p(2)\\n2,:::,p(2)\\nk\\x13\\ndenote two probability distributions satisfying the usual constraints\\nPk\\ni=1p(j)\\ni=1and 0\\x14p(j)\\ni\\x141for all i=1,2,:::,k and j=1,2; and let \\x19(1)and\\x19(2)denote the weights\\nof the distributions p(1)and p(2), satisfying the constraints \\x19(1)+\\x19(2)=1and 0\\x14\\x19(j)\\x141.

Zhenzhu Harbor, Guangxi, China\\nMFI was applied to the high-tidal Sentinel MSI image (acquired 2017-09-28). Figure 9 shows\\nthe MFI image (Figure 9A), mangrove forest distribution classiﬁed from MFI image (Figure 9B), and\\nreference map (Figure 9C) derived from low-tide Sentinel MSI images (described in Section 2.3).\\nAccording to the results shown in the reference map (Figure 9C), the total area of mangrove forests was\\n856.30 ha, with 107.05 ha of submerged and 749.25 ha of emerged mangrove forests. In Figure 9B, the\\ntotal area of mangrove forest we classiﬁed from the MFI image was 849.4 ha, which means 99% of the\\nmangrove forest pixels were successfully extracted from water background by the MFI. According to\\nTable 3, the overall accuracy of this mangrove map is 97% with a Kappa coe \\x0ecient of 0.94. In Zhenzhu\\nHarbor, the MFI value of emerged mangrove forests, submerged mangrove forests, and water pixels\\nrange from 0.19 to 0.30, \\x000.01 to 0.18, and\\x000.2 to\\x000.01.\\nFigure 9.

Dalhousie Island, Sundarbans, India\\nSundarbans has the biggest patch of mangrove forest ﬂourishing on the world’s largest delta\\n(Ganga–Bramhaputra–Meghna Delta; [ 47]). The tidal amplitude within the estuary ranges from 3.5\\nto 4 m, with seasonal variation between 1 and 6 m; mangrove forests are periodically submerged\\nduring high tide [ 48,49]. In this study, Dalhousie Island (located in the southern part of Sundarbans,\\nIndia) was chosen as a typical area to validate the performance of the MFI. Figure 10 shows a local\\nhigh-tidal MSI image (Figure 10A, captured on 2016-10-17), the MFI-derived image (Figure 10B), andRemote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 12 of 17\\nground-truth images obtained by Google Earth snapshot (Figure 10a–c). As shown in Figure 10A, in\\nmangrove swamps, a number of patches seem similar to seawater. In Figure 10a–c, although these\\npatches show white tones, they are lower and sparser mangrove forests that are intermittently ﬂooded\\nby tides. Fortunately, these patches have positive values in the MFI image (Figure 10B). According to\\nMondal and Saha (2018), Dalhousie Island had 5950 ha of mangrove forests on 2015-08-03 [ 50]. In the\\nMFI image, the extent of mangrove extracted by the MFI is 6105 ha (pixels with positive MFI values),\\naccounting for 102% of Mondal and Saha’s result. Although the MSI image was captured during high\\ntide, almost all the local mangrove forests were detected by the MFI. According to Table 3, the overall\\naccuracy of this mangrove map is 96.8%, with a Kappa coe \\x0ecient of 0.93. In Dalhousie Island, the MFI\\nvalue of emerged mangrove forests, submerged mangrove forests, and water pixels range from 0.11 to\\n0.25, 0 to 0.10, and –0.03 to 0.\\nFigure 10.

Baia do Arraial, Amazon Coast, Brazil\\nBaia do Arraial is located along the south coasts of S ão Lu ís city, Brazil (Figure 11). The coastal\\nzone of S ão Lu ís is dominated by a semidiurnal tide; the high energy causes a maximum tidal height\\nof 8 m during the equinoctial spring tide. Therefore, numerous mangrove trees and shrubs would\\nbe submerged during high tides. As shown in Figure 11A, on 2018-06-14, patches in the northwest\\nand the middle of mangrove swamps were submerged; fortunately, these mangrove forests showed\\npositive values in Figure 11B, and the snapshot of Google Earth images conﬁrmed that these places\\nwere occupied by low mangrove forests. Therefore, we concluded that submerged mangrove forests\\nin Baia do Arraial could be detected by the MFI. According to Table 3, the overall accuracy of this\\nmangrove map is 91.7%, with a Kappa coe \\x0ecient of 0.83. In Baia do Arraial, the MFI values of emerged\\nmangrove forests, submerged mangrove forests, and water pixels range from 0.09 to 0.25, 0 to 0.09, and\\n\\x000.06 to 0.Remote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 13 of 17\\nFigure 11.

Advantages and Potential Applications of MFI\\nLocated along intertidal zones, mangrove forests are always relatively small patches; therefore,\\nmisclassiﬁcation of a small area would greatly a \\x0bect mapping results. The lack of full consideration\\nof tidal conditions would cause misclassiﬁcation between mangrove forests and water background.\\nTo accurately map and manage mangrove forests, in this study, we attempt to extract all mangrove\\nforests during local high tides. Undeniably, using VIs to extract mangrove forests is not new. All the\\ncommonly used indices are applicable to detecting emerged mangrove forests. However, during high\\ntides, according to our statistics in Figure 7, in LSWI, MNDWI, NDVI, and FAI images 27%, 8%, 19%,\\nand 5% of submerged pixels were mixed with water background. Furthermore, based on the result of\\nJensen–Shannon divergence, MFI greatly increased the distance of submerged mangrove forests and\\nwater. However, in the MFI image, nearly all the submerged pixels were completely separated from\\nthe water background. Furthermore, all traditional vegetation indices have a vital uncertainty, that\\nallow for the determination of the threshold of VIs. Fortunately, based on the theory of being above\\nthe baseline, one advantage of using the MFI in detecting mangrove forests is that the threshold is at\\nthe ﬁxed value of zero.\\nThis study provides an index built by Sentinel-2 MSI bands for discriminating submerged\\nmangrove forests from water background. It supports the ﬁndings of previous studies that the NIR\\nand red-edge provide great opportunities in discriminating between vegetation and water. Sentinel-2\\nMSI image contains ﬁve bands in NIR region, four of which were used to build the MFI. The FAI was\\nalso established based on baseline theory, but with one NIR band. However, according to Figure 7\\nand our statistics, unlike MFI (completely separated submerged mangrove forest and water), in the\\nFAI image, 5% of submerged mangrove forests pixels were mixed with water pixels. This is primarily\\nbecause unexpected ﬂuctuation in one NIR band could greatly a \\x0bect the value of the FAI. The four MSI\\nred-edge bands demonstrated relatively stable discrimination between submerged mangrove forest\\nand water.\\nTheoretically, the MFI concept can be applied to other sensors that contain spectral channels of red,\\nNIR, and SWIR, for example, the Landsat OLI sensor which has a red band ranging from 630 to 690 nm,\\nan NIR band ranging from 840 to 890 nm, and a SWIR band ranging from 2100 to 2300 nm. However,\\ndi\\x0berent sensors may acquire di \\x0berent MFI values due to the di \\x0berent ranges of red, NIR, and SWIR\\nbands. Furthermore, the performance of the Sentinel-2 MSI red-edge bands will also be present on\\nthe Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) sensor [ 51]. Therefore, the adaptability of\\nthe MFI to other remote sensing sensors still requires further examination. Moreover, the MFI was\\ndesigned based on the reﬂectance peak in the NIR spectral regions of green vegetation. Therefore,Remote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 14 of 17\\nthe MFI has great potential in detecting any submerged or emerged vegetation in aquatic environments,\\nsuch as ﬂoating algae and aquatic macrophytes. However, considering the various environments\\nwhere aquatic vegetation grows, the applicability of the MFI in detecting other aquatic vegetation still\\nwarrants further exploration.\\n4.2. Uncertainties Leading to Overestimation of Mangrove Forests Using the MFI\\nThis study demonstrates that there are abundant di \\x0berences in the spectral reﬂectance between\\nsubmerged mangrove forests and water bodies. In addition, the spectral curves of submerged and\\nemerged mangrove forests showed similar concave–convex characteristics (Figure 5). Therefore, the\\nMFI function can e \\x0eciently identify and detect mangrove forests from water background. However,\\nthe MFI was designed based on the reﬂectance peak between red and SWIR; any other vegetation that\\ncontains absorption signatures of chlorophyll in aquatic environment can also be detected [ 17,36,52].\\nHence, pixels containing ﬂoating vegetation (for example, algae) and other aquatic macrophytes (for\\nexample, Spartina alterniﬂora ) may be classiﬁed as mangrove forest. Additionally, due to limits in image\\nresolution, a small area of the water could still be classiﬁed as mangrove forests, due to having similar\\nspectral characteristics as nearby mangrove forests. These uncertainties can lead to overestimation of\\nmangrove forests by the MFI. In our application in Dalhousie Island, Sundarbans, India, the bias of\\narea of mangrove forests obtained by MFI is 2% larger.\\n4.3. Limitations Leading to Underestimation of Mangrove Forests Using the MFI\\nIn this study, MFI was created based on the typical reﬂectance curves of submerged mangrove\\nforests. However, the spectral curve of submerged mangrove forest can be a \\x0bected by several factors,\\nincluding water transparency (turbidity), distance that mangrove canopy under the water surface, and\\nthe coverage of mangrove forest [ 15]. Liew and Chang proved that the spectral curves of submerged\\nvegetation changes when water turbidity and depth change [ 53]. They demonstrated that with high\\nturbidity (50 nephelometric turbidity units), green vegetation could not be distinguished at a water\\ndepth of 0.5 m. In addition, with low turbidity (0.5 nephelometric turbidity units), typical vegetation\\nreﬂectance was undetectable at a water depth of 1 m. Chen et al. discovered that when submerged\\nvegetation coverage was less than 40%, it is di \\x0ecult to detect vegetation based on the NIR peak in\\nthe spectral reﬂectance curve [ 15]. Unfortunately, water ﬂow in mangrove swamps always has high\\nturbidity, and newly grown trees at the edge of mangrove forests always have low coverage. According\\nto our ﬁeld measurement, in Zhenzhu Harbor, submerged mangrove forests with a depth of 60 cm\\nunder the water surface would not be detected by MFI. Moreover, due to limits of image resolution,\\nsmall parts of the mangrove forests may be classiﬁed as water due to low tree coverage. As shown in\\nFigure 12, in Zhenzhu Harbor, low mangrove forests along tidal creeks were not identiﬁed by MFI.\\nThese limitations lead to underestimation of the areal extent of mangrove forests by the MFI.\\nFigure 12. Intermittently ﬂooded mangrove forests in local low tide period.\\n5. Conclusions\\nBased on the spectral response curves of submerged mangrove forests, a new vegetation index\\n(MFI) was developed to distinguish mangrove forests from the water background. To take fullRemote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 15 of 17\\nadvantage of the di \\x0berences in reﬂectance between submerged mangrove forests and the water\\nbackground, Sentinel-2 MSI bands, red and SWIR2 were selected to build a linear baseline, and the\\naverage reﬂectance value of four red-edge bands above the baseline was deﬁned as mangrove forest\\nindex (MFI). This new vegetation index is more advantageous in detecting submerged mangrove\\nforests than the traditional NDVI, LSWI, MNDWI, and FAI indices. According to the results of\\nJensen–Shannon divergence, MFI signiﬁcantly widens the distance of submerged mangrove forest and\\nwater pixels compared to other VIs (the Jensen-Shannon divergence values of MFI, FAI, NDVI, LSWI,\\nand MNDWI are 0.209, 0.077, 0.012, 0.003, and 0.121, respectively). Theoretically, 100% of submerged\\nmangrove forests could be extracted from MFI images. Practically, application of the MFI in three\\nglobal mangrove sites showed 99% to 102% of submerged mangrove forests were successfully extracted\\nfrom the MFI image. The overall accuracy of classiﬁcation results obtained from the MFI image ranged\\nfrom 91.7% to 97.6%. According to our ﬁeld measurements in Zhenzhu Harbor, MFI is insensitive to\\nmangrove forests with canopies under 60 cm of the water surface. There are some uncertainties and\\nlimitations, but the MFI was proven to be e \\x0bective in detecting the extent and condition of mangrove\\nforests from high-tide Sentinel MSI images. Although the repeatability and portability of the MFI is\\nstill a work in progress, this index brings great beneﬁts to remote sensing communities of coastal and\\naquatic vegetation studies.\\nAuthor Contributions: M.J. and Z.W. designed the research, process the data, and wrote the manuscript draft.\\nY.Z. helped with designed research and reviewed the manuscript.
