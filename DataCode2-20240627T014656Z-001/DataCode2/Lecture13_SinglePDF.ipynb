The combination of functions, goods and ecological services has a fundamental \\nimportance for society. The study of physiographic types is intended to help in dealing with and understanding \\nthe function of a complex system. Complex systems are those that share four attributes: diversity of constituents, \\ninterdependence between parts, connectedness and adaptation. This study was carried out in the Cananéia region, \\nlocated in the southern coast of the São Paulo State (25oS), Brazil. Data from the 1980’s to 2009 on the structural \\ndevelopment of mangrove forests of two physiographic types, fringe and basin, were analyzed to discern patterns \\nof  spatial  and  structural  organization.  The  fringe  forests  studied  in  the  region  presented  a  predominance  of \\nRhizophora  mangle  and  high  structural  development  due  to  the  high  inundation  frequency  in  depositionally \\nstable sites. Fringe forests, located in progradation areas with low tidal energy, were dominated by Laguncularia \\nracemosa  with  low  structural  development.  The  basin  forests  are  dominated  by  R.  mangle  or  L.  racemosa, \\npresenting reduced structural development in function of the lower inundation frequency, a predominantly sandy \\nsubstrate and low salinity. But some basin forests dominated by  Avicennia schaueriana were better developed \\nreflecting the growth characteristic of this species. The results shown here highlight the large variations in the \\nquality and intensity of forcing functions and the structural and functional diversity allowed by the plasticity of \\nthe species involved and their capacity to interact and adjust to the environment in which they develop. \\n \\nADITIONAL INDEX WORDS: dynamics, self-organisation, management \\n\\nINTRODUCTION \\n\\ntropical  and \\n\\nMangrove  forests  once  covered  more  than  200,000  km2  of \\nsheltered \\nsubtropical  coastlines.  They  are \\ndisappearing worldwide at 1 to 2% per year, a rate greater than or \\nequal  to  declines  in  adjacent  coral  reefs  or  tropical  rainforests. \\nLosses are occurring in almost every country that has mangroves, \\nand  rates  are  rising  more  rapidly  in  developing  countries,  where \\nmore than 90% of the world’s mangroves are located (Duke et al., \\n2007). \\n\\nMangroves  perform  several  functions  such  as  inundation \\ncontrol, protection from erosion, storm, floods, and wave damage, \\n\\nrecreation  and  tourism,  and  generate  tangible  goods  such  as  fish \\nand shellfish and forest products. They possess distinct ecological \\nattributes  at  multiple  levels  of  organization  such  as  site  or  stand, \\necosystem and landscape levels (Schaeffer-Novelli et al., 2005).  \\n\\nManagement  decisions  are  normally \\n\\ntaken  based  on \\ninadequate  or  poor  information  or  incomplete  or  distorted \\nperspectives that fail to acknowledge or grasp the complexity and \\nextent of the system (Schaeffer-Novelli et al., 2008). Coastal and \\nmarine  research  and  conservation  needs  to  be  more  holistic  and \\ndynamic  than  terrestrial  management  because  of  the  greater \\nopenness of these ecosystems, the nature of the embedding matrix \\nand  the  multiplicity  of  cross  scale  linkages  between  the  objects \\n\\nJournal of Coastal Research, Special Issue 57, 2011 \\n349\\n\\n\\x0cEcological processes and conservation of the mangrove ecosystem \\n\\n \\n\\nState, (SE Brazil), at 25ºS. The region is characterized by a wide \\ncoastal plain, with an approximate area of 2,500 km2, bordered on \\nthe northeast and southwest by beach ridges. The average annual \\ntemperature of Cananéia is 21.4ºC, with a mean annual rainfall of \\n2,270mm (Schaeffer-Novelli et al., 1990b). In this area the tide is \\nof the mixed type, with a mean height of 0.81m. The Iguape River \\nis the largest freshwater input of the region. \\n\\nMangroves  colonise  practically  the  entire  coastal  system \\ndominated by quaternary sediments. The region can be considered \\nas  being  reasonably  well  conserved  from  the  point  of  view  of \\nhuman  interference.  Next  to  agriculture  and  tourism,  activities \\nlinked to fishing are the principal economic activities of the local \\ncommunity (Grasso and Schaeffer-Novelli, 1999). \\n\\nMETHODS \\n\\nData  from  1980’s  to  2009  on  the  structural  and  functional \\ncharacteristics  of  the  mangrove  forests  of  Cananéia  region  were \\nanalyzed \\ntypes, \\nterms  of \\ncomplemented by recent field observation. \\n\\nthe  different  physiographic \\n\\nin \\n\\nInformation on the region presented by Adaime (1985), Peria \\net  al.  (1990),  Menezes  (1994),  Coelho-Jr.  (1998)  and  Cunha-\\nLignon  et  al.  (2009)  were  obtained  according  to  the  same \\nmethodology (Cintrón and Schaeffer-Novelli, 1984), thus enabling \\ncomparison with their results. \\n\\nRegression equations were calculated using tree diameter and \\ndensity  values  of  plots  representing  mangrove  forests \\nin \\nprogradation  areas,  fringe  and  basins  types,  from  Coelho-Jr. \\n(1998) and Cunha-Lignon et al. (2009). \\n\\n \\n\\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \\n\\nThe  results  reflect  the  great  structural  and  spatial  variability \\nthat  exists  in  the  Cananéia  mangrove  geomorphic  setting  (Figure \\n2).This structural variability reflects the diversity of environments \\nand  depositional  facies  within  the  setting  and  the  different \\nintensities of subsidiary energies (hydrodynamic forces acting on \\nthe system (Table 1). Changes in hydrology and water quality are \\nimportant indicators, as change in these parameters can influence \\ncolonization,  succession  and  zonation  and  in  time  can  cause \\nincreased tree mortality and consequent alteration of the structural \\ncharacteristics  of  the  stand  and  eventual  changes  in  depositional \\n\\nembedded  in  it  (e.g.  Dahdouh-Guebas  and  Koedam,  2008). \\nManagement  for  resilience  and  monitoring  becomes  essential  in \\nmangrove area management (Schaeffer-Novelli et al., 2008).  \\n\\nAn analysis of mangrove forests must take into consideration \\nthe  hydrological  energy  regime  of  a  coast,  the  first  step  for \\nunderstanding its functional and structural responses when facing \\nenvironment, stress and management changes (Lugo  et al., 1990; \\nBosire  et  al.,  2008).  The  source  of  environmental  energy \\ndetermines  the  characteristics  of  the  ecosystem,  its  distribution \\nand  form  being  defined  by  the  spatial  distribution  of  this  energy \\n(Lugo  et  al.,  1990).  Subsidiary  energies  (non  solar)  possesses \\ndiverse  essence  and  quality,  which  are  not  readily  comparable \\n(Lugo et al., 1990). However maximum utilization of the energies \\navailable  comes  from  the  interaction  of  these  different  quality \\nenergies so that they amplify each other (Odum, 1983). Lugo and \\nSnedaker  (1974)  presented  a  physiographic  classification  of \\nmangrove  forests  (fringe,  riverine,  basin,  overwash,  scrub,  and \\nhammocks),  assuming  that  each  type  reflects  the  energy  sources \\nand quality spectra of a given place. In fact the energy of sunlight \\nis a multiple source described by its spectrum and includes visible \\nand photosynthetically active light as well as heat. \\n\\nCintrón et al. (1985) suggested that this classification could be \\nreduced  to  three  broad  types  (fringe,  riverine  and  basin). \\nOverwash  mangroves  were  considered  to  be  basically  self-\\nenveloping fringes, whereas scrub and hammocks were considered \\nto  be  special  types  of  basins.  Fringe  forests  are  located  at  the \\nedges  of  water  bodies  (estuaries  and  bays)  and  are  frequently \\nflooded by tides. Riverine forests are located at the edges of rivers. \\nWhereas basin forests occur in inland areas that are less frequently \\nflooded by tides and where an accumulation of organic matter and \\nanoxia can be found in the sediment. \\nSchaeffer-Novelli  et  al. \\n\\ntwo \\nphysiographic  types  (fringe  and  basin),  considering  the  riverine \\ntype  as  a  fringe.  The  main  criteria  used  to  describe  these  major \\ntypes  are  water  movement  and  the  hydroperiod  in  a  system. \\nFringes and riverine forests are considered flowing water systems. \\nBasins  are  still-water  systems.  Riverine  stands  are  considered  a \\ntype  of  fringe;  its  structural  attributes  are  derived  from  the \\nparticular  setting  they  occupy  (where  lower  salinities  and  high \\nnutrient levels prevail). \\nThe  study  of \\n\\nthe \\nthe  physiographic \\nunderstanding of the great variability and complexity of structural \\nand  functional  development,  as  a  result  of  the  response  of \\nmangrove  plant  species  to  abiotic  factors  (Schaeffer-  Novelli  et \\nal. 1990a). \\n\\nsuggested  only \\n\\ntypes  helps \\n\\n(2000) \\n\\nin \\n\\nBased  on  the  physiographic  classification  of  mangrove \\nforests  and  the  energy  signature  concept,  the  objective  of  this \\nwork  is  to  help  to  understand  mangrove  dynamics  and  give  a \\ncontribution to the conservation and management of the Cananéia \\nregion (State of São Paulo, Brazil). \\n\\n \\n\\nStudy Area \\n\\nThe mangrove distribution and theirs characteristics along the \\nBrazilian  coast  is  profoundly  influenced  by  coastal  types  and \\nprocess scales (Schaeffer-Novelli et al., 2000). Schaeffer-Novelli \\net al. (1990a) proposed a division of the Brazilian coast into eight \\nsegments  (I-VIII)  where  similar  environmental  conditions, \\ngeomorphologic  processes,  disturbance  regimes  and  landscape \\nmosaics predominate. \\n\\nThe  study  area  is  situated  in  the  Cananéia-Iguape  Coastal \\nSystem (Figure 1), localized in segment VII (Schaeffer-Novelli et \\nal.,  1990a),  along  the  southern  tract  of  the  coast  of  São  Paulo \\n\\nFigure  1.

Gaertn. F. \\n(Combretaceae) with low structural development and high density \\n(Figure 2), and were associated to the smooth cordgrass Spartina \\nalterniflora Loiseleur (Poaceae) (Cunha Lignon et al., 2009). \\n\\nThe  basin  forests  studied  in  Coelho-Jr  (1998)  were  found  to \\nbe  dominated  by  R.  mangle,  presenting  reduced  structural \\ndevelopment and low density due to the low inundation frequency, \\npredominantly sandy sediment, and low salinity values (Figure 2). \\nHowever, sites studied by Adaime (1985) and Cunha-Lignon et al. \\n(2009)  proved  to  be  well  developed  due  to  the  dominance  and \\nstructural  characteristics  of  (Avicennia  schaueriana  Stapf.  & \\nLeechman  (Acanthaceae),  (Figure  2),  which  occupied  areas  with \\nmore  uniform  physical-chemical  characteristics  and  energy  flow. \\nIn  the  Cananéia  region,  some  of  the  basin  forests  are  associated \\nwith  the  rear  part  of  the  mangroves,  next  to  the  restingas, \\nseparated by a narrow transition zone, occupied by Cyperaceae, as \\nwell as Hibiscus pernambucensis Arruda, Acrosthicum aureum L., \\nAnnona glabra L. and Dalbergia ecastophyllum (L.) Taub. Some \\nbasin  forests  present  similar  characteristics  to  fringe  forests  in \\naccretion  areas,  with  high  density  and  low  tree  diameter  (Figure \\n2).  The  stability  of  each  site  should  be  the  main  responsible  to \\ndifferences between forest types. \\n\\nBased  on  distinct  physiographic \\n\\ntypes  and  vegetation \\ncharacteristics,  submitted  to  different  subsidiary  energy,  we \\nproposed some strategies to manage mangrove forests of Cananéia \\nregion (Table 1). \\n\\nThe  destruction  of  this  part  of  the  forest  by  reclamation  for \\nreal  state  causes  significant  changes  in  hydrological  conditions \\n\\nand consequently in forest dynamics, forcing alteration in zonation \\npatterns,  besides  the  loss  of  primary  productivity  (Brown,  1990) \\nand spatial diversity, and effects on carbon dynamics (Bouillon et \\nal., 2004; Bosire et al., 2005). \\n\\nHydrological and tidal flows are considered as a crucial source \\nof  subsidiary  energy  in  wetlands  (Lugo  et  al.,  1990).  In  general, \\nthe mangrove forests of the Cananéia region are strongly coupled \\nand  influenced  by  hydrological  processes  such  as  frequent \\nflooding  by  freshwater  or  tidal  energy.  Mangrove  development \\nhere  reflects  the  diversity  of  depositional  settings  within  a \\ntransgressive barrier island estuarine-lagoonal system where these \\nflows  produces  a  diversity  of  tide  dominated  morphologies  that \\nbecome the template for mangrove colonization. This depositional \\nsystem  is  characterized  by  the  diversity  of  morphological  units, \\ntheir  interconnectedness  and  interdependence,  dynamism  and \\nadaptive  open-endedness.  The  system  self-assembles,  and \\nrecognition of this has important implications for management. \\n\\nHuman  activities  which  directly  affect  fringe  forests,  by \\neliminating plant cover and extraction of mangrove products, can \\nreduce.  Requisite  variety  and  overcome  the  carrying  capacity  of \\nthe ecosystem leading to environmental degradation (Lugo  et al., \\n1990)  or  chronically  reduce  its  robustness  leading  to  cryptic \\necological  degradation  (Dahdouh-Guebas  et  al.,  2005),  which  in \\nturn  may  affect  mangrove  functionality  (Dahdouh-Guebas  & \\nKoedam,  2008)  particularly  its  capacity  to  recover  from  external \\ndisturbances. \\n\\nIftekhar and Saenger (2008) analyzed the vegetation dynamic \\nin  the  Bangladesh  Sundarbans  mangroves  reviewing  forest \\ninventories from 1926 to 1997, the authors encountered limitations \\narising  from  the  need  to  compare  information  obtained  using \\ndifferent  methodologies  and  different  measurements  of  the  same \\nparameters.

This \\ncharacteristic makes the management of this system simpler, being \\nlimited  to  the  conservation  of  the  properties  and  processes  that \\ncontrol them (Cintrón-Molero and Schaeffer-Novelli, 1992).  \\n       Mangroves have played a vital role in the development of the \\nLatin American and Caribbean countries and their value increases \\nas \\ntropical  countries  develop  and  ecological  values  are \\nincreasingly  recognized  (Lugo,  2002).  Effective  governance \\nstructures,  socioeconomic  risk  policies,  and  education  strategies \\nare needed now to enable societies around the world to reverse the \\ntrend  of  mangrove  loss  and  ensure  that  future  generations  enjoy \\nthe  ecosystem  services  provided  by  such  valuable  natural \\necosystems (Duke et al., 2007). \\n       Technical  information  per  se  does  not  represent  the  total  of \\nnecessary  subsidies  for  the  conservation  of  complex  coastal \\necosystems,  such  as  mangroves.  Government  institutions  should \\ncontribute  with  the  implementation  of  environmental  awareness \\nprograms  and  integrated  coastal  management  planning.  Local \\ngovernments often possess detailed information on the necessities \\nand  problems  of  the  coastal  zone  communities,  pointing  out \\nconflicts  and \\nthat  could  affect  certain  decisions. \\nUnfortunately  the  people  most  familiar  with  natural  systems  are \\nnot  usually  in  powerful  positions  and  are  not  consulted  by  those \\nwho  are.  The  groups  of  coastal  enterprises  besides \\nlocal \\ncommunities  should  be  supported  at  all  governmental  levels \\n(Cicin-Sain and Knecht, 1998). \\n\\nlimits \\n\\n \\n\\nCONCLUSION \\n\\nover  the  past  decades  of  research  made  it  possible  to  examine \\necological  processes,  assisting \\nthe  conservation  and \\nin \\nmanagement of this valuable ecosystem. \\n\\nthe \\n\\nimplementation  of \\n\\nTechnical information, government support and information of \\nlocal communities should be worked over together, being essential \\nintegrated  coastal  management \\nfor \\nprograms. It is possible to manage mangrove areas considering the \\nopportunities  for  the  recreation,  tourism,  fishing,  education  and \\nresearch which they offer, without requiring much manipulation of \\nthe system, and conserving the material and nutrient (energy) flow \\nwhich sustains its production and control the water quality. \\n\\n \\n\\nLITERATURE CITED \\n\\nAdaime,  R.
