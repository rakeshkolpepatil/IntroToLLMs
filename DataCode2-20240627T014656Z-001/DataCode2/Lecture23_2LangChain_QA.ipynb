Additionally, mil-\\nlions of coastal residents live around mangrove ecosystems and draw\\nheavily from their goods and services ( Atkinson et al., 2016 ;Gevana\\net al., 2015 ).\\nThe proximity of mangroves to coastal population centers leads to\\nmassive degradation and loss.

They can be found in countries such as China, where 57.3% of China's mangroves are scattered along the coastline of Guangdong. However, mangroves are facing extinction in many countries due to land use and land cover changes, such as tree harvesting, logging, and clear-cutting for aquaculture ponds. Mangrove clearance for urban expansion and coastal infrastructure development has also contributed to their loss. Efforts are being made to conserve and restore mangrove habitats through improved management and policies. \\nSOURCES: /content/drive/MyDrive/LLM_1/MangrovePDFs/Simulating-spatial-change-of-m-8cd5240a-17b3-4292-957d-5005ea324adc.pdf\"}"
