tropical trees and shrubs that grow in sheltered intertidal zones.\\nAccurate mapping of mangrove forests is a great challenge for remote sensing because mangroves are\\nperiodically submerged by tidal ﬂoods. Traditionally, multi-tides images were needed to remove the\\ninﬂuence of water; however, such images are often unavailable due to rainy climates and uncertain\\nlocal tidal conditions. Therefore, extracting mangrove forests from a single-tide imagery is of great\\nimportance. In this study, reﬂectance of red-edge bands in Sentinel-2 imagery were utilized to\\nestablish a new vegetation index that is sensitive to submerged mangrove forests. Speciﬁcally, red\\nand short-wave near infrared bands were used to build a linear baseline; the average reﬂectance\\nvalue of four red-edge bands above the baseline is deﬁned as the Mangrove Forest Index (MFI).\\nTo evaluate MFI, capabilities of detecting mangrove forests were quantitatively assessed between\\nMFI and four widely used vegetation indices (VIs). Additionally, the practical roles of MFI were\\nvalidated by applying it to three mangrove forest sites globally. Results showed that: (1) theoretically,\\nJensen–Shannon divergence demonstrated that a submerged mangrove forest and water pixels have\\nthe largest distance in MFI compared to other VIs. In addition, the boxplot showed that all submerged\\nmangrove forests could be separated from the water background in the MFI image. Furthermore, in\\nthe MFI image, to separate mangrove forests and water, the threshold is a constant that is equal to\\nzero. (2) Practically, after applying the MFI to three global sites, 99–102% of submerged mangrove\\nforests were successfully extracted by MFI. Although there are still some uncertainties and limitations,\\nthe MFI o \\x0bers great beneﬁts in accurately mapping mangrove forests as well as other coastal and\\naquatic vegetation worldwide.\\nKeywords: Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI); red-edge band; aquatic vegetation; tidal\\ncondition; vegetation index; coastal vegetation\\n1. Introduction\\nMangrove forest are highly productive ecosystems with signiﬁcant ecological and socio- economic\\nimportance in the world [ 1,2]. However, over the past century, these forests have declined at an\\nalarming rate that is more rapid than that of inland tropical forests [ 3]. Therefore, there is an emerging\\ndemand for conservation and restoration e \\x0borts in mangrove forests. Obtaining accurate information\\nRemote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043; doi:10.3390 /rs11172043 www.mdpi.com /journal /remotesensingRemote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 2 of 17\\nregarding the current and past acreage and condition of mangrove forests is essential for e \\x0ecient\\nmanagement of these ecosystems and for policy- and decision-making processes [4,5].\\nLocated in intertidal zones, mangrove forests are often inaccessible for traditional ﬁeld surveys.\\nFor decades, remote sensing has been widely used to monitor the distribution of mangrove forests, yet\\naccurate and timely interpretation of the relatively small patches has been rare, due to the lack of full\\nconsideration of tidal conditions [ 6–9]. Mangrove forests located near the shoreline are periodically\\nsubmerged by tides, especially in regions with high tide ﬂuctuations and lower mangrove shrubs [ 9,10].\\nIdeally, it is better to use images acquired during low tides; however, such data are di \\x0ecult to obtain,\\ndue to uncertainties of local instantaneous tidal conditions during predetermined times that satellites\\npass over [ 11,12]. For a long time, numerous studies have pointed out that tides may seriously\\ninﬂuence remote sensing results of mangrove forests, yet, solutions were not reported until the past\\ntwo years [ 10,13,14]. However, all these studies used multi-tides (multi-date) images; therefore, we\\nhave one concern: if multi-tides images are not available due to rainy climates and uncertain local tide\\nconditions, how could we accurately map mangrove forests by a single-date image?\\nOver the last two decades, remote sensing of submerged and emerged aquatic vegetation has\\nbeen widely studied [ 15,16]. Hyperspectral image with numerous narrow and contiguous bands is\\nreliable for studying aquatic vegetation and is able to detect the biophysical properties of vegetation\\ne\\x0eciently [ 16–19]. However, there is no freely available satellite hyperspectral data in recent years, and\\nairborne applications are exorbitantly expensive and only cover a very small spatial extent. Landsat\\nimages with moderate spatial resolution of 30–60 m have been widely used for mapping aquatic\\nvegetation [ 20–24]. Yet, Landsat only has one band in the spectral region of near infrared (760–900 nm),\\nwhich may become less sensitive as water depth increases [ 25]. The MODIS (Moderate Resolution\\nImaging Spectroradiometer) and AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) are publicly\\navailable with high spectral resolution but coarse spatial resolution (250–1100 m, respectively), making\\nthem unsuitable for mangrove detection [ 9]. In contrast, the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument\\n(MSI) sensor has a 10–20 m spatial resolution and ﬁve bands in near infrared region, which provides\\nopportunities to conduct quick, robust, and e \\x0ecient monitoring of submerged mangrove forests.\\nFor years, numerous methods were utilized to map mangrove forests as well as other aquatic\\nvegetation from remote sensing imagery, ranging from pixel to object-oriented approach, and manual\\nto unsupervised methods [ 9,14,26–28]. Recently, machine-learning algorithms such as random\\nforest, neural network, and support vector machine provide promising accuracy in mangrove forests\\nextraction [ 10,13,29]. As it is hard to locate representative training samples due to uncertain tidal\\nconditions, it is relatively hard to apply these methods to extract submerged mangrove forests from\\na single-date image. Vegetation indices (VIs), which are mathematically determined based on the\\nspectral characteristics of vegetation, have been proven e \\x0ecient in monitoring vegetation from\\nspace [ 30]. The Normalized Di \\x0berence Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the most commonly used index\\nin global vegetation studies (e.g., [ 30,31]). The Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and the Modiﬁed\\nNormalized Di \\x0berence Water Index (MNDWI) were proposed and widely used for mapping surface\\nwater [ 32–34]. Given that these indices are established based on di \\x0berences between two bands,\\nthey are insensitive to small variations of the reﬂectance of submerged mangrove forests and water\\nbackground [ 14]. Furthermore, it is hard to decide thresholds that distinguish submerged mangroves\\nand water. With more bands, several VIs were built based on a baseline theory, such as Maximum\\nChlorophyll Index (MCI; [ 35]), the Floating Algae Index (FAI; [ 36]), and the Floating Vegetation Index\\n(FVI; [ 17]). However, these indices were deﬁned to extract ﬂoating vegetation (above water surface)\\nfrom water, not submerged vegetation. Meanwhile, bands used to build MCI and FVI did not exist in\\nSentinel MSI image.\\nThus, the objective of this study is to develop a new vegetation index, called the Mangrove Forest\\nIndex (MFI), which is capable to map the distribution of mangroves based on a single date MSI image.\\nThen, we will compare MFI with other widely used VIs to validate MFI’s capabilities in detecting\\nsubmerged mangrove forests from water background. Additionally, MFI will be applied to three sitesRemote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 3 of 17\\nof typical mangrove forests worldwide; the practical roles of mapping mangrove forests during local\\nhigh-tide conditions will also be discussed.\\n2. Materials and Methods\\n2.1. Sentinel-2 Imagery\\nSentinel-2, a European Space Agency (ESA) land-monitoring mission, has two matching satellites\\nthat provide high-resolution optical imagery. Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B carry the MultiSpectral\\nInstrument (MSI) and were successfully launched in June 2015 and March 2017 respectively and\\nprovide important means to augment earth observation capabilities [ 37]. These satellites revisit the\\nsame location every 2 to 5 days. The MSI sensor o \\x0bers 13 spectral bands, with four bands at 10 m, six\\nbands at 20 m, and three bands at a 60 m spatial resolution (Table 1) and o \\x0bers a wide range of earth\\nobservation applications [38].\\nIn this study, Sentinel-2 MSI images were downloaded from European Space Agency Sentinels\\nScientiﬁc Data Hub; the images were preprocessed with geometric and radiometric corrections at\\nsub-pixel accuracy. Then, atmospheric correction (converting top-of-atmosphere reﬂectance into\\ntop-of-canopy reﬂectance) was performed by the tool of SEN2COR (version 2.05.05), which was\\navailable in the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) toolbox [ 39,40]. In order to standardize di \\x0berent\\nspatial resolutions of bands in MSI images, we excluded bands with a spatial resolution of 60 m (Band\\n1, Band 9, and Band 10). After atmospheric correction, all remaining bands were resampled to a pixel\\nsize of 20 m\\x0220 m.\\nTable 1.

Study Area\\nThe study area, Zhenzhu Harbor (21\\x0e280–21\\x0e420N and 108\\x0e000–108\\x0e200N), is located in Guangxi\\nProvince, China, in the southwest portion of mainland China and the north region of Tonkin Gulf\\n(Figure 1). In Zhenzhu Harbor, mangrove forests are mainly composed of four communities: Comm. A.\\nmarina, Comm. A. corniculatum, Comm. A. marina–A. corniculatum, and Comm. K. candel–A. corniculatum .\\nThe tides in the coast of Zhenzhu Harbor are diurnal, with an average tidal range of 2.24 m, and\\nmangrove forests here are primarily younger shrubs with an average height of less than 3 m [ 7].\\nTherefore, the Zhenzhu Harbor is a typical area for the study of submerged mangrove forests, due to a\\nlarge area of pioneer mangrove trees and shrubs that would be entirely submerged during high tides\\n(Figure 1A,B). Information of MSI images we selected are shown in Table 2.Remote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 4 of 17\\nAdditionally, a ﬁeld survey of Zhenzhu Harbor was conducted during April 2017, in which 408\\nground truth samples were collected including samples of mangrove forest, open water, and other\\nland cover.\\nFigure 1.

Build a Reference Map\\nGround surveys were conducted along the coasts of Zhenzhu Harbor in November 2017. The\\nlocation of each sampling point was measured using a global positioning system (GPS), with an error\\nless than 1 m. The observations collected in the surveys contained 85 mangrove points and 81 water\\npoints. A vector ﬁle of ground survey points with the attributes of location (longitude and latitude),\\nland cover types, and photos was created with ArcGIS.\\nThe spectral curves of water, submerged mangrove forests, and emerged mangrove forests were\\nextracted from images. The workﬂow of discriminating these classes is shown in Figure 2. A reference\\nmap was built based on object-oriented methods and visual interpretation.\\nThe description of the object-oriented method can be found in Harayama and Jaquet [ 41]. The\\neCognition Developer 9.0, an image analysis program, was used to conduct object-oriented classiﬁcation.\\nVisual interpretation was performed to classify objects as either mangrove forests or water. To facilitateRemote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 5 of 17\\nvisual interpretation, a false color composite of MSI Bands 11 (centered 1610 nm), Band 8 (centered\\n842 nm), and Band 4 (centered 665 nm) was generated. This band combination that was deemed the\\nbest for detecting mangroves which appears dark green color [ 42]. Furthermore, in order to conduct the\\nadjustment in a robust manner, visual interpretation was performed by an experienced remote sensing\\nexpert who was familiar with this area. First, we identiﬁed mangrove forest and surrounding water\\nfrom the low-tide MSI image. Subsequently, a confusion matrix was generated using the independent\\nground-truth samples described in Section 2.2. With this matrix, we achieved an overall classiﬁcation\\naccuracy of 97% with a Kappa coe \\x0ecient of 0.92, which indicated excellent agreements between our\\nmapping results and ground-truth data. Therefore, mangrove forests identiﬁed with this method\\nwere assumed to cover entire area of local mangrove forests. Second, using the same techniques as\\nabove, mangrove forests were identiﬁed from the high-tide MSI image. Finally, the extent of the\\nsubmerged mangrove was determined by subtracting the high-tide from the low-tide mangrove forest\\nmap. Figure 3 shows the distributions of emerged mangrove forests and submerged mangrove forests\\nin the high-tidal MSI image.\\nFigure 2. Work ﬂow for identifying submerge mangrove forests.Remote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 6 of 17\\nFigure 3. Distribution of emerged and submerged mangrove forests in high-tide MSI image.\\n2.4. Theories\\nFigure 4 shows the ﬁeld measurements of spectral curves of the water, emerged vegetation,\\nand submerged vegetation, generated by Chen et al. (2018; Figure 4A) and Visser et al. (2015;\\nFigure 4B) [ 15,25]. As normal green plants, vegetation above the water surface showed high reﬂectance\\nin the spectral region of 770–890 nm. Waterbody is characterized by low reﬂectance in near infrared at\\n700 nm while emerged mangrove has a relatively high reﬂectance, which make them separable from\\neach other. However, when mangroves are submerged under water, the reﬂectance is largely reduced,\\ntherefore, it is di \\x0ecult to distinguish submerged vegetation from waterbody [ 15,25,43]. As measured,\\nwhen submerged vegetation are 43–51 cm below clear water, the NDVI value was close to zero, which\\nmeans no di \\x0berences were observed between the red band and NIR band [44].\\nHowever, by careful inspection of the spectral curves shown in Figure 4A,B, two reﬂectance\\npeaks ranging from approximately 690–740 nm and 810–830 nm were found, even for the curves of\\nvegetation located 40 cm below the water surface. These peaks result from the competing e \\x0bects\\nof the chlorophyll reﬂectance plateau and the absorption e \\x0bects of water located within submerged\\nvegetation and the surrounding water background. However, traditional multispectral satellite sensors\\ncould not capture these reﬂectance peaks. Fortunately, the MSI sensor has ﬁve channels that cover\\nthese regions. Figure 5 shows the typical spectral curves of water (WB), emerged mangrove forest\\n(EMF), and submerged mangrove forest (SMF) that are observed on the MSI image. As shown in\\nFigure 5, the emerged and shallow submerged mangrove forest pixels demonstrated a strong reﬂection\\nin the region of 660–900 nm, the absorption valleys appeared in bands 4 (centered wavelength 665 nm)\\nand 12 (centered 2160 nm). For the submerged mangrove forest (b) curves, a small reﬂectance peak\\nappeared in the 660–900 nm region; the absorption valley also appeared in bands 4 (centered 665 nm)\\nand 12 (centered 2160 nm). The reﬂectance of the water pixels shows a continuous decreasing tendency\\nbeginning with band 4 (central wavelength 665 nm). Therefore, comparing submerged curves to water\\ncurves, the higher reﬂectance in bands 5 (centered 705 nm), 6 (centered 740 nm), 7 (centered 783 nm),\\n8 (centered 842 nm), and 8A (centered 865 nm) could be used to distinguish submerged mangrove\\nforests from the water background.Remote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 7 of 17\\nFigure 4.

Existing Vegetation Indices\\nPreviously, NDVI (Equation 1), LSWI (Equation 2), and MNDWI (Equation 3) and FAI (Equation\\n4) were used in detecting vegetation from water bodies [33,34,45].\\nNDVI =\\x1aNIR\\x00\\x1aRed\\n\\x1aNIR+\\x1aRed(1)\\nLSWI =\\x1aNIR\\x00\\x1aSWIR\\n\\x1aNIR+\\x1aSWIR(2)\\nMNDWI =\\x1aGreen\\x00\\x1aSWIR\\n\\x1aGreen +\\x1aSWIR(3)\\nFAI=\\x08\\x1a860\\x00[\\x1a1240+(\\x1a660\\x00\\x1a1240)\\x02(1240\\x00860)/(1240\\x00660)]\\t(4)\\nwhere\\x1aGreen ,\\x1aRed,\\x1aNIR, and\\x1aSWIR are the reﬂectance of the green, red, NIR, and SWIR, respectively.\\nHowever, these indices are not suitable for discerning submerged vegetation from water bodies,\\nbecause there are no obvious reﬂectance di \\x0berences in bands green, red, and SWIR between submerged\\nvegetation and water bodies (Figures 4 and 5).Remote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 8 of 17\\n2.6. Formulation of MFI\\nFor this study, according to the analysis in Section 2.4, the absorption valleys in band 4 (centered\\n665 nm) and band 12 (centered 2190 nm) could be used to form a baseline (Figure 6). In order to\\nenhance the stability of di \\x0berences between submerged mangrove forests and the water background,\\nthe average value of reﬂectance of band 5 (centered 705 nm), band 6 (centered 740 nm), band 7 (centered\\n783 nm), and band 8A (centered 865 nm) above the baseline, is deﬁned as MFI. Band 8 was excluded\\nbecause Bands 7 (centered 783 nm) and 8A (centered 865 nm) covered most of its spectra, and its\\nspectral range overlaps with the water absorption region. The mathematical formulation is\\nMFI =h\\n(\\x1a\\x151\\x00\\x1aB\\x151)+(\\x1a\\x152\\x00\\x1aB\\x152)+(\\x1a\\x153\\x00\\x1aB\\x153)+(\\x1a\\x154\\x00\\x1aB\\x154\\x11\\n]/4 (5)\\n\\x1aB\\x15i=\\x1a2190+(\\x1a665\\x00\\x1a2190)\\x02(2190\\x00\\x15i)/(2190\\x00665) (6)\\nwhere the \\x1a\\x15is the reﬂectance of the band center of \\x15, and iranged from 1 to 4; \\x151,\\x152,\\x153,\\x154represent\\nthe center wavelengths at 705, 740, 783 and 865 nm, respectively. \\x1aB\\x15iis the baseline reﬂectance in\\n\\x15i.\\x1a665and\\x1a2190are the reﬂectance of band 4 (centered at 665 nm) and 12 (centered at 2190 nm),\\nrespectively. Pixels with an MFI value above 0 are recognized as mangrove forests.\\nFigure 6.

Quantitative Comparison between MFI and Other VIs\\nIn this study, Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD)—a measure of distance between a ﬁnite number\\nof distributions—was adopted to compare sensitivities of MFI and other VIs. The JSD ( D) quantiﬁes\\nthe di \\x0berence between two or more probability distributions. In this study, it was used to compare\\nthe di \\x0berences between submerged mangrove forests and water pixels in di \\x0berent VI images. The\\nDvalue, which was calculated in MATLAB, is deﬁned as follows: let p(1)\\x11(p(1)\\n1,p(1)\\n2,:::,p(1)\\nk)\\nand p(2)\\x11\\x12\\np(2)\\n1,p(2)\\n2,:::,p(2)\\nk\\x13\\ndenote two probability distributions satisfying the usual constraints\\nPk\\ni=1p(j)\\ni=1and 0\\x14p(j)\\ni\\x141for all i=1,2,:::,k and j=1,2; and let \\x19(1)and\\x19(2)denote the weights\\nof the distributions p(1)and p(2), satisfying the constraints \\x19(1)+\\x19(2)=1and 0\\x14\\x19(j)\\x141.

Zhenzhu Harbor, Guangxi, China\\nMFI was applied to the high-tidal Sentinel MSI image (acquired 2017-09-28). Figure 9 shows\\nthe MFI image (Figure 9A), mangrove forest distribution classiﬁed from MFI image (Figure 9B), and\\nreference map (Figure 9C) derived from low-tide Sentinel MSI images (described in Section 2.3).\\nAccording to the results shown in the reference map (Figure 9C), the total area of mangrove forests was\\n856.30 ha, with 107.05 ha of submerged and 749.25 ha of emerged mangrove forests. In Figure 9B, the\\ntotal area of mangrove forest we classiﬁed from the MFI image was 849.4 ha, which means 99% of the\\nmangrove forest pixels were successfully extracted from water background by the MFI. According to\\nTable 3, the overall accuracy of this mangrove map is 97% with a Kappa coe \\x0ecient of 0.94. In Zhenzhu\\nHarbor, the MFI value of emerged mangrove forests, submerged mangrove forests, and water pixels\\nrange from 0.19 to 0.30, \\x000.01 to 0.18, and\\x000.2 to\\x000.01.\\nFigure 9.

Dalhousie Island, Sundarbans, India\\nSundarbans has the biggest patch of mangrove forest ﬂourishing on the world’s largest delta\\n(Ganga–Bramhaputra–Meghna Delta; [ 47]). The tidal amplitude within the estuary ranges from 3.5\\nto 4 m, with seasonal variation between 1 and 6 m; mangrove forests are periodically submerged\\nduring high tide [ 48,49]. In this study, Dalhousie Island (located in the southern part of Sundarbans,\\nIndia) was chosen as a typical area to validate the performance of the MFI. Figure 10 shows a local\\nhigh-tidal MSI image (Figure 10A, captured on 2016-10-17), the MFI-derived image (Figure 10B), andRemote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 12 of 17\\nground-truth images obtained by Google Earth snapshot (Figure 10a–c). As shown in Figure 10A, in\\nmangrove swamps, a number of patches seem similar to seawater. In Figure 10a–c, although these\\npatches show white tones, they are lower and sparser mangrove forests that are intermittently ﬂooded\\nby tides. Fortunately, these patches have positive values in the MFI image (Figure 10B). According to\\nMondal and Saha (2018), Dalhousie Island had 5950 ha of mangrove forests on 2015-08-03 [ 50]. In the\\nMFI image, the extent of mangrove extracted by the MFI is 6105 ha (pixels with positive MFI values),\\naccounting for 102% of Mondal and Saha’s result. Although the MSI image was captured during high\\ntide, almost all the local mangrove forests were detected by the MFI. According to Table 3, the overall\\naccuracy of this mangrove map is 96.8%, with a Kappa coe \\x0ecient of 0.93. In Dalhousie Island, the MFI\\nvalue of emerged mangrove forests, submerged mangrove forests, and water pixels range from 0.11 to\\n0.25, 0 to 0.10, and –0.03 to 0.\\nFigure 10.

Baia do Arraial, Amazon Coast, Brazil\\nBaia do Arraial is located along the south coasts of S ão Lu ís city, Brazil (Figure 11). The coastal\\nzone of S ão Lu ís is dominated by a semidiurnal tide; the high energy causes a maximum tidal height\\nof 8 m during the equinoctial spring tide. Therefore, numerous mangrove trees and shrubs would\\nbe submerged during high tides. As shown in Figure 11A, on 2018-06-14, patches in the northwest\\nand the middle of mangrove swamps were submerged; fortunately, these mangrove forests showed\\npositive values in Figure 11B, and the snapshot of Google Earth images conﬁrmed that these places\\nwere occupied by low mangrove forests. Therefore, we concluded that submerged mangrove forests\\nin Baia do Arraial could be detected by the MFI. According to Table 3, the overall accuracy of this\\nmangrove map is 91.7%, with a Kappa coe \\x0ecient of 0.83. In Baia do Arraial, the MFI values of emerged\\nmangrove forests, submerged mangrove forests, and water pixels range from 0.09 to 0.25, 0 to 0.09, and\\n\\x000.06 to 0.Remote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 13 of 17\\nFigure 11.

Advantages and Potential Applications of MFI\\nLocated along intertidal zones, mangrove forests are always relatively small patches; therefore,\\nmisclassiﬁcation of a small area would greatly a \\x0bect mapping results. The lack of full consideration\\nof tidal conditions would cause misclassiﬁcation between mangrove forests and water background.\\nTo accurately map and manage mangrove forests, in this study, we attempt to extract all mangrove\\nforests during local high tides. Undeniably, using VIs to extract mangrove forests is not new. All the\\ncommonly used indices are applicable to detecting emerged mangrove forests. However, during high\\ntides, according to our statistics in Figure 7, in LSWI, MNDWI, NDVI, and FAI images 27%, 8%, 19%,\\nand 5% of submerged pixels were mixed with water background. Furthermore, based on the result of\\nJensen–Shannon divergence, MFI greatly increased the distance of submerged mangrove forests and\\nwater. However, in the MFI image, nearly all the submerged pixels were completely separated from\\nthe water background. Furthermore, all traditional vegetation indices have a vital uncertainty, that\\nallow for the determination of the threshold of VIs. Fortunately, based on the theory of being above\\nthe baseline, one advantage of using the MFI in detecting mangrove forests is that the threshold is at\\nthe ﬁxed value of zero.\\nThis study provides an index built by Sentinel-2 MSI bands for discriminating submerged\\nmangrove forests from water background. It supports the ﬁndings of previous studies that the NIR\\nand red-edge provide great opportunities in discriminating between vegetation and water. Sentinel-2\\nMSI image contains ﬁve bands in NIR region, four of which were used to build the MFI. The FAI was\\nalso established based on baseline theory, but with one NIR band. However, according to Figure 7\\nand our statistics, unlike MFI (completely separated submerged mangrove forest and water), in the\\nFAI image, 5% of submerged mangrove forests pixels were mixed with water pixels. This is primarily\\nbecause unexpected ﬂuctuation in one NIR band could greatly a \\x0bect the value of the FAI. The four MSI\\nred-edge bands demonstrated relatively stable discrimination between submerged mangrove forest\\nand water.\\nTheoretically, the MFI concept can be applied to other sensors that contain spectral channels of red,\\nNIR, and SWIR, for example, the Landsat OLI sensor which has a red band ranging from 630 to 690 nm,\\nan NIR band ranging from 840 to 890 nm, and a SWIR band ranging from 2100 to 2300 nm. However,\\ndi\\x0berent sensors may acquire di \\x0berent MFI values due to the di \\x0berent ranges of red, NIR, and SWIR\\nbands. Furthermore, the performance of the Sentinel-2 MSI red-edge bands will also be present on\\nthe Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) sensor [ 51]. Therefore, the adaptability of\\nthe MFI to other remote sensing sensors still requires further examination. Moreover, the MFI was\\ndesigned based on the reﬂectance peak in the NIR spectral regions of green vegetation. Therefore,Remote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 14 of 17\\nthe MFI has great potential in detecting any submerged or emerged vegetation in aquatic environments,\\nsuch as ﬂoating algae and aquatic macrophytes. However, considering the various environments\\nwhere aquatic vegetation grows, the applicability of the MFI in detecting other aquatic vegetation still\\nwarrants further exploration.\\n4.2. Uncertainties Leading to Overestimation of Mangrove Forests Using the MFI\\nThis study demonstrates that there are abundant di \\x0berences in the spectral reﬂectance between\\nsubmerged mangrove forests and water bodies. In addition, the spectral curves of submerged and\\nemerged mangrove forests showed similar concave–convex characteristics (Figure 5). Therefore, the\\nMFI function can e \\x0eciently identify and detect mangrove forests from water background. However,\\nthe MFI was designed based on the reﬂectance peak between red and SWIR; any other vegetation that\\ncontains absorption signatures of chlorophyll in aquatic environment can also be detected [ 17,36,52].\\nHence, pixels containing ﬂoating vegetation (for example, algae) and other aquatic macrophytes (for\\nexample, Spartina alterniﬂora ) may be classiﬁed as mangrove forest. Additionally, due to limits in image\\nresolution, a small area of the water could still be classiﬁed as mangrove forests, due to having similar\\nspectral characteristics as nearby mangrove forests. These uncertainties can lead to overestimation of\\nmangrove forests by the MFI. In our application in Dalhousie Island, Sundarbans, India, the bias of\\narea of mangrove forests obtained by MFI is 2% larger.\\n4.3. Limitations Leading to Underestimation of Mangrove Forests Using the MFI\\nIn this study, MFI was created based on the typical reﬂectance curves of submerged mangrove\\nforests. However, the spectral curve of submerged mangrove forest can be a \\x0bected by several factors,\\nincluding water transparency (turbidity), distance that mangrove canopy under the water surface, and\\nthe coverage of mangrove forest [ 15]. Liew and Chang proved that the spectral curves of submerged\\nvegetation changes when water turbidity and depth change [ 53]. They demonstrated that with high\\nturbidity (50 nephelometric turbidity units), green vegetation could not be distinguished at a water\\ndepth of 0.5 m. In addition, with low turbidity (0.5 nephelometric turbidity units), typical vegetation\\nreﬂectance was undetectable at a water depth of 1 m. Chen et al. discovered that when submerged\\nvegetation coverage was less than 40%, it is di \\x0ecult to detect vegetation based on the NIR peak in\\nthe spectral reﬂectance curve [ 15]. Unfortunately, water ﬂow in mangrove swamps always has high\\nturbidity, and newly grown trees at the edge of mangrove forests always have low coverage. According\\nto our ﬁeld measurement, in Zhenzhu Harbor, submerged mangrove forests with a depth of 60 cm\\nunder the water surface would not be detected by MFI. Moreover, due to limits of image resolution,\\nsmall parts of the mangrove forests may be classiﬁed as water due to low tree coverage. As shown in\\nFigure 12, in Zhenzhu Harbor, low mangrove forests along tidal creeks were not identiﬁed by MFI.\\nThese limitations lead to underestimation of the areal extent of mangrove forests by the MFI.\\nFigure 12. Intermittently ﬂooded mangrove forests in local low tide period.\\n5. Conclusions\\nBased on the spectral response curves of submerged mangrove forests, a new vegetation index\\n(MFI) was developed to distinguish mangrove forests from the water background. To take fullRemote Sens. 2019 ,11, 2043 15 of 17\\nadvantage of the di \\x0berences in reﬂectance between submerged mangrove forests and the water\\nbackground, Sentinel-2 MSI bands, red and SWIR2 were selected to build a linear baseline, and the\\naverage reﬂectance value of four red-edge bands above the baseline was deﬁned as mangrove forest\\nindex (MFI). This new vegetation index is more advantageous in detecting submerged mangrove\\nforests than the traditional NDVI, LSWI, MNDWI, and FAI indices. According to the results of\\nJensen–Shannon divergence, MFI signiﬁcantly widens the distance of submerged mangrove forest and\\nwater pixels compared to other VIs (the Jensen-Shannon divergence values of MFI, FAI, NDVI, LSWI,\\nand MNDWI are 0.209, 0.077, 0.012, 0.003, and 0.121, respectively). Theoretically, 100% of submerged\\nmangrove forests could be extracted from MFI images. Practically, application of the MFI in three\\nglobal mangrove sites showed 99% to 102% of submerged mangrove forests were successfully extracted\\nfrom the MFI image. The overall accuracy of classiﬁcation results obtained from the MFI image ranged\\nfrom 91.7% to 97.6%. According to our ﬁeld measurements in Zhenzhu Harbor, MFI is insensitive to\\nmangrove forests with canopies under 60 cm of the water surface. There are some uncertainties and\\nlimitations, but the MFI was proven to be e \\x0bective in detecting the extent and condition of mangrove\\nforests from high-tide Sentinel MSI images. Although the repeatability and portability of the MFI is\\nstill a work in progress, this index brings great beneﬁts to remote sensing communities of coastal and\\naquatic vegetation studies.\\nAuthor Contributions: M.J. and Z.W. designed the research, process the data, and wrote the manuscript draft.\\nY.Z. helped with designed research and reviewed the manuscript.

CREATING \\nGREAT \\nFOOD FOR \\nA BETTER \\nFUTURE\\n 4\\nBega Cheese Limited 2022 Sustainability Report 5\\nBega Cheese Limited 2022 Sustainability ReportMessage from Executive \\nChairman and CEO\\nBarry Irvin\\nExecutive ChairmanPaul van Heerwaarden\\nChief Executive Officer\\n 6\\nBega Cheese Limited 2022 Sustainability Report25 October 2022 25 October 2022We are pleased to present our eighth \\nannual Sustainability Report. Through our  \\nacquisition of the Bega Dairy and Drinks  \\nbusiness, the company has now doubled \\nin size in 18 months. During this period, \\nwe have worked hard on bringing  \\ntogether Bega Group while managing \\nmultiple challenges. The ongoing \\nCOVID-19 pandemic and significant \\nflood events disrupted logistics, \\nwhile geopolitical tensions added \\nsignificantly to cost pressures. \\nOur changing business \\nIn FY2022, we have focused on maintaining the smooth  \\noperation of the Bega Dairy and Drinks business. The acquisition  \\nof Bega Dairy and Drinks added cafes, impulse, government,  \\naged care and healthcare to our traditional grocery,  \\nco-manufacturing and quick service restaurant customers, \\nextending the range of products supplied to those customers \\nand leveraging greater value from our distribution network. \\nThis financial year saw growth across some key categories \\nincluding yoghurt, chilled juice, spreads and milk-based \\nbeverages. We continued to innovate our products \\nand packaging. In FY2022, we released a new Squeezy \\npeanut butter product in packaging with 30% recycled \\ncontent and received independent certification under \\nthe Rainforest Alliance Sustainable Agriculture Standard \\nfor Dare Iced Coffee. We have also removed 1,000 tonnes \\nof added sugar from Bega Dairy and Drinks portfolio \\nsince 2020, reaching our 2025 target 2 years early.\\nWhile we continue to monitor consumer preferences \\nfor healthy and convenient foods, we also work with \\nresearch partners to address specific dietary needs in the \\ncommunity. This year, we launched 180 Nutrition Good \\nSport to support post-exercise recovery. We also launched \\nAustralia’s first milk product for toddlers to offer different \\nnutrients for consumption during the day and night.\\nGlobal challenges and local impacts\\nExtreme weather events have contributed to disruptions \\nand increased our costs. Floods in Queensland, New South \\nWales, South Australia and parts of Victoria occurred between \\nDecember 2021 and into June 2022. These events disrupted \\nmilk supply and caused minor damage to this year’s peanut \\ncrop. Flooding in South Australia, for example, closed the rail \\nlink to Western Australia and product had to be delivered by \\ntruck increasing freight costs. Most farms were able to continue \\nmilking with production losses of around 20% of most flood-\\nimpacted farms. Our Better Farms Program funded field visits \\nto impacted farms to advise on wet weather management \\nand funding was made available to repair infrastructure. The ongoing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict \\nin Ukraine have resulted in significant increases in our input \\ncosts this year, ranging from energy and packaging to coffee \\nand sugar. Absenteeism and labour shortages associated \\nwith the pandemic impacted our manufacturing sites and \\ndistribution networks and also those of our customers.\\nSuch pressures are a serious threat to food security \\nglobally. As a food producer, Bega Group has a significant \\nrole to play in managing these challenges while feeding \\nmore people over the long term. To address acute food \\ninsecurity in Australia, we partnered with Foodbank in \\nFY2022 to donate 1,072,267 kilograms of products, equating \\nto more than 1.9 million meals for Australians in need.\\nGreater Good\\nOur vision is to become The Great Australian Food Company \\nby creating great food for a better future. We continue to build \\non and consolidate our approach to sustainable development. \\nWhile we have made progress in some areas, bringing together \\npolicies and data collection systems remains an area of focus \\nfor Bega Group. Our strategy - Greater Good – continues to \\nprovide direction. It is aligned to the United Nations Sustainable \\nDevelopment Goals (UN SDGs), specifically our contribution \\nto the UN Sustainable Development Goal #2 – to end hunger, \\nachieve food security and improved nutrition and promote \\nsustainable agriculture. The principles of the circular economy \\ninform action and our participation in the Bega Circular \\nValley project provides a living example in the region.\\nThis year, we adopted a Planet Pledge to improve our performance  \\non energy, carbon, water, packaging and waste. This includes \\nthe following targets: zero waste to landfill by 2025, a 30% \\nreduction in water use by 2030, net zero carbon by 2050 \\nand packaging to be reusable, recyclable or compostable by \\n2025. We have also started to measure our scope 3 emissions \\nwhich are associated with our supply chain, particularly dairy \\nfarming. We have started to engage with key suppliers to share \\ninformation and explore reduction opportunities. In FY2023 we \\nwill formally assess our climate-related risks and opportunities \\nconsistently with the recommendations of the Taskforce on \\nClimate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and report on \\nthat work in the Annual Report and Sustainability Report.\\nOur Ethical Sourcing Policy was updated this year to reflect  \\na single approach for Bega Group. All of our new suppliers  \\nin FY2022 were screened using our ethical sourcing  \\nself-assessment questionnaire and all new suppliers  \\nassessed as medium to high-risk completed an independent \\ncompliance audit. We will publish our third modern slavery \\nstatement later this year and have identified high risk \\ncommodities for their potential impact on the environment \\nand people, including coffee, cocoa, rice powder and fish oil.\\nWe have recently signed on to the 40:40 Vision which \\nis an investor-led initiative to achieve gender balance \\nin executive leadership across all ASX300 companies \\nby 2030. This commitment includes making a pledge to \\nachieve gender balance in executive leadership by 2030, \\npublishing a plan to get there and reporting annually on our \\nprogress. We will also commence public reporting on the \\nratio of female to male salaries next year. While we have \\nmore work to do, as a food producer we are optimistic \\nabout how we can contribute to a more sustainable future. \\nWe thank our staff, customers, farmers, shareholders and \\nthe communities where we operate for their support.\\n 7\\nBega Cheese Limited 2022 Sustainability Report2001\\nSeek new\\nopportunities2007\\nGrow and\\ndiversify2009\\nIncrease\\nscale2011\\nStructure for\\nthe future2017\\nNew business\\nplatform2018\\nStrengthen\\nour supply chain2021\\nTransformational\\nacquisitionFuture \\nA Great Australian \\nFood CompanyOUR TRANSFORMATION  \\nTO BECOMING  \\nA GREAT AUSTRALIAN \\nFOOD COMPANY.\\nOur vision is to become The Great \\nAustralian Food Company by creating \\ngreat food for a better future.\\nCo-operative  \\nfounded in 1899\\nIndustry deregulation \\n2001\\nBega based co-op with \\nstrong regional brand\\nMain focus: cheddar \\nmanufacture, process \\nand pack\\nLong-term Australian \\nsupply and licence \\nagreement with Fonterra\\nDeveloping international \\nsales opportunities Acquisition of \\nTatura\\nGrowth and \\ndiversification of  \\nmilk sourcing\\nEntry into nutritionals, \\ncream cheese and  \\nmilk powders\\nDiversification of \\ncustomer baseAcquisition of \\nStrathmerton\\nCut, pack and \\nprocessing scale  \\nand capability\\nFurther diversification  \\nof customer baseAccessing \\ncapital for \\ngrowth\\nSuccessful ASX listing\\nValue release for farmers\\nWell structured for \\ncorporate activity\\nAcquisition of the \\nremaining stake in Tatura\\nInvestment in capacity \\nand increased focus  \\non nutritionals and \\nhigh-value dairy products\\nDeveloping  \\nfoodservice and \\nconsumer businesses\\n 8\\nBega Cheese Limited 2022 Sustainability Report2001\\nSeek new\\nopportunities2007\\nGrow and\\ndiversify2009\\nIncrease\\nscale2011\\nStructure for\\nthe future2017\\nNew business\\nplatform2018\\nStrengthen\\nour supply chain2021\\nTransformational\\nacquisitionFuture \\nA Great Australian \\nFood Company\\nAcquisition of \\ngrocery brands\\nEntry into spreads \\ncategory\\nIconic Australian  \\nbrands, including \\nVegemite\\nExtending the Bega \\nbrand into new \\ncategories\\nInvesting in sales and \\nmarketing capability\\nAcquisition of PCA  \\nto secure Australian \\nsource of peanutsAcquisition  \\nof Koroit\\nGrowth and \\ndiversification of  \\nmilk sourcing\\nStrengthening our  \\ndairy portfolio\\nIntegrated and flexible \\nsupply chain\\nScale ingredient \\nprocessing supporting \\ncustomer brands\\nDecision to  \\nclose sub-scale \\nmanufacturing  \\nfacility in CoburgAcquisition of \\nDairy and Drinks\\nPortfolio of iconic \\nAustralian brands\\nBroaden customer  \\nbase and new cold  \\nchain distribution \\nnetwork\\nSubstantial synergies \\nacross the supply chain\\nAccelerated \\ninvestments in growth \\nand innovation\\nFurther growth and \\ndiversification of  \\nthe milk poolCreating great \\nfood for a  \\nbetter future\\nDiversified portfolio of \\nmarket-leading brands\\nEfficient distribution \\nnetwork servicing \\ncustomer growth\\nGlobally competitive \\nsupply chain\\nDirect relationship with \\nfarmers and suppliers\\nShaping our future \\nthrough sustainability \\nand circularityIn FY2022 the Bega Group generated top line normalised \\nrevenue of $3.01 billion.

Our brand portfolio strength, priorities and strategies are crucial to  \\nlong-term sustainable value creation.\\nThe ongoing investment in brand building and innovation ensures we compete  \\nin attractive and growing product segments, capitalise on emerging consumer  \\ntrends, remain relevant, and win consumer preference.\\nOur brands and markets\\nOur brands continue to be some of Australia’s favourite \\nhousehold names.

We now also hold 50% of the milk based beverage \\nmarket and 25.1% of the yoghurt market. Through our joint \\nventure with Vita International Holdings Limited, we also hold \\n29.3% of the plant based milk market in Australia. Increased \\nconsumption of grocery items in homes, due to the COVID-19 \\npandemic, has resulted in continued growth. We continue to \\ninnovate across both our core brands such as Dare, Farmers \\nUnion, Dairy Farmers, Daily Juice and Yoplait while also \\nintroducing new offers like 180N Good Sport, a science backed \\nnutritional beverage, expanding Mildura into a sparkling fruit drink \\nand extending our range into bulk food service pack formats. \\nWe supply a range of high-quality products to the Australian \\nfood service industry from cheese to condiments, dressings, \\nmayonnaise, spreads and portion control staples.

The Code of \\nConduct provides a framework of principles that Bega Group  \\nas a company and subsidiary companies will abide by in \\nbusiness and dealing with stakeholders. All employees play an \\nimportant role in ensuring that the high standards of ethics \\nand behaviour that Bega Group is committed to are observed. \\nThe Code of Conduct also covers Bega Group’s reciprocal \\ncommitment to fulfil its responsibilities to all employees. \\nEmployees complete a Code of Conduct Declaration \\nupon employment and participate in refresher training \\nevery 12 months to ensure awareness of any changes. \\nOur Board, as at 30 June 2022, consists of 7 directors. \\nDirectors, and their other current directorships, are \\nlisted on pages 36 and 37 of our FY2022 Annual Report. \\nProfiles of Directors are also detailed on our website. \\nThe Audit and Risk Committee monitors and reviews the risk \\nregister at least annually to assess the degree to which material \\nrisks are being effectively managed, and to ensure that all \\nmaterial financial and compliance risks are adequately reflected \\nin the financial statements. Our approach to risk is based on  \\nAS/NZS ISO 31000:2009. Managers are responsible for \\ncompliance with risk management policies and processes \\nand ensuring that key controls are in place and effective. \\nTwo Committees address the sourcing of our two key raw \\nmaterials - peanuts and milk. The Peanut Growing and \\nBreeding Committee and the Milk Services Committee \\nsupport the Board in developing strategies to ensure \\npeanut and milk supply. They also work with the Board on \\nstrategies to foster strong relationships with our valued \\nfarmer suppliers. A Dairy and Drinks Integration Committee \\nwas initiated following the acquisition of Lion Dairy and \\nDrinks and is tasked with overseeing the integration of the \\nLion Dairy and Drinks business into the Bega Group. Our approach to tax at Bega is to be prudent in managing tax \\nrisk and adopting a low risk appetite. The Board oversees overall \\ntax risk and delegates specific responsibility to the Audit and \\nRisk Committee as set out within Bega’s Tax Risk Management \\nand Governance Policy. We seek to maintain a collaborative \\nand trusted relationship with the Australian Taxation Office \\nand other revenue authorities. Bega is committed to ensuring \\nthat it is compliant with applicable legislation, regulations, \\nreporting and disclosure requirements in the countries in which \\nwe operate. In FY2022, the Bega Group paid income taxes of \\n$11.9 million (net of income tax refunds). In addition to income \\ntax, Bega Group is subject to other taxes such as payroll tax, \\nproperty taxes and fringe benefits tax. Bega Group also collects \\nand remits taxes including PAYG withholding tax, net goods \\nand services tax and customs duty on behalf of the Australian \\nGovernment. Bega has a strong history of paying fully franked \\ndividends to shareholders and in FY2022 the results of Bega \\nGroup continued to support the total payment of fully franked \\ndividends of 11 cents per share for the entire year. For more \\ninformation on Bega Group’s income tax, please refer to Notes \\nto the Financial Statements in the FY2022 Annual Report.Our vision is to be the Great Australian Food Company by creating great food for a better \\nfuture.

Specifically: \\nproduct safety & quality, water availability & efficiency, animal \\ncare, physical climate risk, farm biosecurity, antimicrobial \\nstewardship, calves (including bobby calves), animal husbandry, \\nresilience of dairy regions and greenhouse gas emissions.\\nAlthough we did not undertake any dedicated stakeholder \\nengagement to inform the report this year, we regularly \\nengage with stakeholders at key milestones including \\nduring contract renewals, at negotiation of supply and \\nservices agreements, and when advising the community \\nof significant changes to activities at operating sites. \\nStakeholders How we engage\\nMilk & peanut suppliers Direct from Supply Team via email and text\\nMonthly newsletter\\nOther suppliers and \\nbusiness partnersDirect interviews\\nSupplier visits and audits\\nMeetings and regular reviews\\nUse of tools such as SEDEX\\nShareholders Results presentations\\nASX announcements and press releases\\nAnnual General Meeting\\nRoadshows\\nESG investment surveys\\nCustomers and consumers Responses to questionnaires\\nCustomer visits and audits\\nMeetings and review\\nMonthly reports\\nGovernments and regulators Input to requests for information\\nParticipation in system audits\\nStrategic meetings with regulator\\nDairy Export Industry \\nConsultative Committee\\nStatutory reporting\\nSite inspection and audits\\nIndustry associationsFormal participation in industry \\ninitiatives and frameworks. \\nNon-government \\norganisations and \\ncertification bodiesFormal participation in programs  \\n(e.g. The Australian Packaging Covenant) \\nWorkers Face to face workshops\\nSafety briefings\\nNewsletter (Bega Bites)\\nEmployee engagement survey\\nCommunities of operation Face to face workshops\\nParticipation in regional industry initiatives\\nFigure 9: Our stakeholders and how we engage with them \\n 21\\nBega Cheese Limited 2022 Sustainability ReportOur Products\\nFOOD AND \\nNUTRITIONMaking better, healthier food\\nWe own and manufacture some of the most iconic food \\nbrands in Australia, including Bega Cheese, Vegemite and \\nBega Peanut Butter. Through the acquisition of Bega Dairy \\nand Drinks in January 2021, we have added a range of milk \\nand dairy brands, juice and plant-based products to our \\nportfolio. As a food producer, we have a unique opportunity \\nto contribute to the wellbeing of people and to have a \\npositive impact on specific health and nutrition challenges. \\nOur approach is underpinned by our Bega Sustainable Diet \\nPrinciples. We are currently developing our Bega Wellbeing \\nPledge to be launched in FY2023. The Pledge will bring together \\nthe Bega Cheese Nutrient Profiling Standard, developed in \\n2019, and the Bega Dairy and Drinks Our Goodness Promise, \\ndeveloped in 2014 and updated in 2020. The Pledge will outline \\nour strategies, targets and activities to support a sustainable diet \\nthrough our products, promotions and education for wellbeing.\\nWe continue to support the changing lifestyles and needs of \\nconsumers by enhancing and improving our product portfolio. \\nReducing consumption of added sugar and added salt in the diet \\ncan improve health and reduce the risk of significant lifestyle \\ndiseases, such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease. We are \\non track to remove 15 tonnes of salt from Bega Cheese food \\nproducts and to reduce sugar by 10% in Bega Peanut Butter by \\n2023, having achieved a 5% reduction in FY2021. Our Bega Dairy \\nand Drinks business has removed 1,000 tonnes of added sugar \\nfrom our portfolio and is on track to providing 100 million more \\nno added sugar serves by 2025, having provided 26 million \\nmore since 2020. Bega Dairy and Drinks has also been able to \\nlaunch a number of products toward the goal of 85% of the \\nproduct portfolio meeting either the “best” or “good” categories \\nof products by 2025. This year 80% of the product portfolio \\nmeets the criteria, representing a shift from 70% in 2014. We \\nhave also voluntarily introduced added sugar labelling in the \\nnutrition information panels of 70% of our drinks, yogurt and \\nmilk beverages to help consumers make informed choices. \\nOur science and technology team operates a networked \\nmodel, dedicated to partnerships with research institutions \\nand connecting with our food technology staff. We fund \\nclinical research and post-graduate work on specific \\nhealth challenges and benefits associated with dietary \\nintake. We focus on what is already good about our natural \\nproducts, such as dairy, and look for enhancements \\nwhich are both appropriate and fit for purpose. Meeting the specific nutritional needs of our consumers \\nrequires innovation. Our work in prebiotics continued this \\nyear as consumer interest in supporting gut health increases. \\nIn FY2022, we launched Daily Juice + Pre and Pro-Biotics \\nto support a healthy gut. This adds to our Dairy Farmers \\nGutActive, with prebiotics to support gut health. Our new \\nHappi Day and Night milk product for toddlers is Australia’s \\nfirst to offer different nutrients for consumption during the \\nday and night. Vital nutrients in both cow’s milk and human \\nmilk have circadian day and night cycles. Iron, for example, \\nis crucial to brain development and the production of red \\nblood cells, which peaks in human milk at night. Five types of \\nnucleotides and trytophan are also important to cognition, \\ngrowth and development and also vary between day and night.\\nBega Sustainable Diet Principles\\n 23\\nBega Cheese Limited 2022 Sustainability Report Our ProductsRight portion sizes,  \\neating to needs\\nSelect local\\nLimit waste throughout  \\nthe food supply chain\\nEducate and promote \\nsustainable diet\\nRemoved 1,000 tonnes of added sugar from \\nBega Dairy and Drinks portfolio since 2020, \\nreaching our 2025 target 2 years early.Making food that people trust\\nOur commitment to customers and consumers is that our \\nproducts are safe when used for their intended purpose \\nand meet or exceed all food regulatory requirements. \\nOur Quality Policy formalises this commitment. It applies \\nto all our manufacturing sites, third party manufacturers \\nproducing products on our behalf, and our supply chain. \\nIt is informed by international food safety standards \\nrecognised by the Global Food Safety Initiative. \\nWe maintain 100% certification to schemes such as the \\nBritish Retail Consortium (BRC) Global Standards and \\nFSSC 22000 Global Standards, which are recognised by \\nthe Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI). Our quality and \\nfood safety management systems are frequently audited \\ninternally and extensively by second and third parties. Acting \\non the recommendations from these audits helps us to \\nimprove our performance in both quality and food safety. \\nOur focus over the past year, and into next financial year, \\nis to ensure the highest food safety standards are in place \\nacross the entire business, based on the best from both \\nBega Dairy and Drinks and Bega Cheese and the latest \\nexternal references. We have mapped requirements and \\nprioritised gap assessments, bringing together multiple \\ndocuments into a single approach for Bega Group.\\nOur commitment to food safety extends through our supply \\nchain, where we hold our suppliers to our same standards. Suppliers that have certification to a GSFI recognised scheme \\nare preferred. When they do not, additional risk assessments \\nare performed by Bega Group. We provide support and \\nguidance to suppliers to ensure they comply with our quality \\nand food safety requirements. Through our Milk Supply \\nAgreements, our dairy farmers are required to implement our \\nOn-Farm Quality Assurance Manual and they are supported \\nin this by our regional field services teams. This enables \\ntraceability and helps us to work proactively with farmers.\\nBega Group is committed to ensuring its nutrition \\ncommunications are transparent, legally compliant, truthful \\nand reliable, with claims that have a solid scientific basis. \\nWe continue to be transparent and clear in our marketing, \\nadvertising and labelling practices, with the aim of helping \\nconsumers make better choices. Bega Group is committed \\nto the Australian Association of National Advertisers (AANA) \\nFood and Beverages Advertising Code which regulates food \\nand beverage advertising in Australia.

The Group received 1.40 billion litres \\nof milk during the course of FY2022. Strong global dairy \\nprices and a shrinking milk pool in Australia have increased \\ncompetition for milk and we have increased our farm gate \\nmilk price for the next financial year to secure our supply.\\nThe Bega Group was also impacted this year by \\ndisruptions to supply chains experienced globally. The \\nconflict in Ukraine increased the costs of inputs and \\nlockdowns in Shanghai, due to COVID-19, also disrupted \\nthe flow of products into major Asian markets.\\nFigure 11: Bega Group ethical sourcing programSUPPLIER \\nOBLIGATIONS\\nINTERNAL REVIEW\\nSUPPLIER \\nOBLIGATIONS\\nAUDIT\\nREVIEWResponsible sourcing\\nOur sourcing decisions are guided by our Ethical Sourcing Policy \\nwhich was updated in May 2022. The updated Policy brings together \\nthe responsible and ethical sourcing approaches of Bega Cheese \\nand Bega Dairy and Drinks each of which had their own policies \\nand procedures prior to acquisition in FY2021. Informed by relevant \\ninternational agreements, the revised Policy has been updated to \\nreflect our use of the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (SEDEX), our \\nexpectations of suppliers regarding their participation in SEDEX \\nand provisions for employees and suppliers to raise potential \\ncompliance issues. Our Responsible Sourcing Code then provides \\ngreater detail of our supplier sustainability and responsibility \\naspirations and the minimum standards we expect of suppliers.\\nOur approach is outlined in Figure 11. As active members of SEDEX  \\nwe require suppliers to share their data and we review their \\nresponses against an internationally recognised audit and \\ncompliance program. Our suppliers must also complete an annual \\nethical sourcing self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) and Bega \\nGroup may require an independent compliance audit of the supplier, \\nparticularly those considered to be high risk. This year, 211 of our \\nmedium to high risk suppliers completed the SAQ and 100% of high \\nrisk suppliers have completed an independent compliance audit \\nusing SMETA (Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit) while others \\nare still in progress. Only one business critical non-conformance \\nwas found and resolved. Another 14 critical, 60 major and 60 minor \\nnon-conformances were recorded with a resolution rate of 93%, \\n83% and 93% respectively this year. All of our 22 new suppliers in \\nFY2022 were screened using the SAQ and 8 of the new suppliers \\ndeemed to be medium to high-risk completed an audit.\\nAs part of our participation in SEDEX, we also undergo third party \\nSMETA audits of our own manufacturing sites which, in turn, provides \\nassurance to our major customers. This year we have completed \\naudits for our sites at: Malanda, Kingaroy, Koroit, Bentley, Lagoon \\nStreet, Ridge Street, Salisbury, Lenah Valley and Strathmerton. An \\naudit of the Vegemite Way and Tatura sites is scheduled for FY2023.\\nWe have identified several commodities as high risk for their potential \\nto impact people and the environment. This includes coffee, cocoa, \\nrice powder and fish oil used as ingredients in our products. These \\nwere identified through a risk assessment based on our list of \\nsuppliers, our expenditure and country of origin of the ingredients. \\nWe have commenced further and specific due diligence work with \\nthese suppliers. This year we worked with the Rainforest Alliance to \\nprocure coffee for specific manufacturing sites now independently \\ncertified to the Rainforest Alliance Sustainable Agriculture Standard. 29\\nBega Cheese Limited 2022 Sustainability Report Our People and CommunitiesModern slavery\\nWe will produce our third modern slavery statement at the \\nend of this calendar year in compliance with section 13 of the \\nModern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth) and section 24 of the Modern \\nSlavery Act 2018 (New South Wales). Our Modern Slavery Action \\nPlan is implemented by an internal Modern Slavery Working \\nGroup which reports to the Board and consists of a group of \\ncross functional managers. The Working Group reviews risks \\nand assesses our performance against industry norms and \\nregulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. While \\nour early work in this area focused on identifying potential \\nsources of modern slavery risk in our operations and supply \\nchain, our focus now is on building awareness and trust.Deforestation and palm oil\\nBega Cheese has been an associate member of the Roundtable \\non Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) since December 2019 and \\nadopted a Sustainable Palm Oil Sourcing Policy in 2020. \\nOur goal was to procure 100% of our palm oil and palm \\noil products from RSPO certified Segregated or Identity \\nPreserved sources by December 2020. Our manufacturing \\nsites at Ridge Street, Bega and Strathmerton have maintained \\nRSPO Supply Chain Certification (SCC). Bega Dairy and \\nDrinks also adopted a palm oil policy in 2020 limiting palm \\noil or its derivatives to less than 1.5% of Bega Dairy and Drinks \\nproducts. The policy commits Bega Dairy and Drinks to 100% \\nRSPO certified sustainable palm oil according to the Mass \\nBalance model as a minimum. A reconciled and whole of Bega \\nGroup palm oil policy is to be developed.

While we depend \\non them for quality and reliability of milk supply, they also rely \\non us to add value to their milk and support dairy communities \\nthrough our business. Dairy is in strong demand in most parts \\nof the world and dairy commodity prices have increased this \\nyear. The competition for milk supply continues in Australia \\nas the milk volume shrinks and the global demand for dairy \\nincreases. Our dairy farmers have been impacted this year by \\nrising input costs and a La Niña weather event, resulting in above \\naverage rainfall across the eastern states and significant floods.\\nOur Milk Supply Agreements outline the terms and conditions for \\nour milk suppliers when selling milk to us and our responsibilities \\nto them as a purchaser. The Agreements include details on \\npricing structure, incentives, quality assurance, legal compliance \\nand dispute mechanisms. Suppliers must be accredited under \\nour On Farm Quality Assurance Program which is based on \\nfour components: Hazard Analysis and Standards, On Farm \\nQuality Assurance Plan, On Farm Quality Assurance Monitor \\nBook and Farmer Self-audit or checklist. When on-boarding new \\nsuppliers, our Farm Service Field Officers work through the on-\\nboarding checklist that includes key questions on animal health \\nand welfare practices, biosecurity, chemical use and effluent \\nmanagement. The information is used to identify key areas that \\nmay require improvement to meet workplace health and safety, \\nquality assurance, animal welfare or environmental requirements. \\nThis has not yet been applied to dairy farmers supplying the \\nBega Dairy and Drinks business. If there are areas identified that \\nneed improvement our Farm Service Field Officers encourage \\nimprovement through the Better Farms grant program. \\nWe continue to support our dairy farmers through our Better \\nFarms Program which helps farmers develop and improve their \\nbusiness through capital grants, advice and training. The program \\nhas been extended to now include all of our dairy farmers since \\nthe acquisition of Bega Dairy and Drinks in January 2021. In light \\nof the increasing flood and storm events around the country, \\nthe installation of a back up generator to enable milking has \\nbeen elevated in priority within the program. As part of the \\nCapital Works Grant, our Farm Service Field Officers complete \\na checklist with the farmer to ensure all compliance areas are \\nmet before proceeding with the funding of grants of projects \\nthat are not compliance related. Since April 2018, we have \\ninvested more than $1.9 million in grants, leveraging additional \\nfunding contributions of over $6 million from farmers across 620 \\nprojects. A summary of the grants approved and completed is \\npresented in Figure 13. A dedicated website tracks the program’s \\nachievements, to highlight them to Australian consumers. A third \\nparty provides independent assurance every three years to our \\nstakeholders that grants under the program are being spent on \\nagreed projects.

Bega Group has zero \\ntolerance for animal cruelty. We support the Australian Dairy \\nIndustry Sustainability Framework, which aims for 100% \\ncompliance with legislated Australian Animal Welfare Standards \\nand 100% uptake of relevant recommended practices. This \\nincludes the training of workers in regulatory requirements and \\nthe handling of dairy animals as well as specific practices such \\nas tail docking, disbudding, lameness and calving induction. \\nBega Group does not support tail docking without veterinary \\nadvice and has a strict no tolerance approach to the use of \\ninduction drugs as a routine management practice. Bega Group \\nmay suspend the collection of milk if we reasonably suspect \\nthat there may be material animal health or welfare issues \\nwith respect to the supplier’s milking herd or other livestock.\\nOur Milk Supply Agreements require dairy suppliers to \\ncomply with all applicable laws, regulations and mandatory \\ncodes regarding animal welfare, which includes the National \\nDairy Industry Animal Welfare Strategy. Our On Farm Quality \\nAssurance Plan details requirements and expected practices \\nfor livestock health and welfare as well as the management of \\nspecific conditions such as mastitis and the use of antibiotics. \\nOur Farmer Self-audit checklist for onboarding new suppliers \\nincludes questions on these standards and practices, such as \\nthe use of pain relief when disbudding calves, managing herd \\nfertility to eliminate routine induction, provision of adequate \\nshelter and eliminating tail docking. Animal welfare is also a \\nmajor focus of the Better Farms Program, providing funds \\nfor capital works projects and service support for better calf \\nmanagement and animal health and welfare. These grants help \\nour farmers to improve their practices and levels of compliance.\\nSupporting beekeepers\\nOur honey brand, B honey, is 100% Australian sourced honey \\nfeaturing Red Gum honey from the Murray River region and \\nIronbark honey from North Eastern Victoria. B honey continues \\nto be the driving force behind the Purple Hive Project – an \\ninnovative technology project aimed at reducing biosecurity \\nrisk for the Australian beekeeping industry. The Purple Hive is an \\nartificial intelligence-based monitoring system that has been \\ndesigned to facilitate early detection of a parasitic mite – the \\nVarroa Destructor - which has decimated bee colonies around \\nthe world. Early detection of the mite remains crucial to the \\nhealth of the bee industry and to agriculture in Australia. \\nAustralia was, until recently, the last inhabited country on earth \\nfree of the mite. In June of this year the mite was detected in \\na sentinel hive at the Port of Newcastle. The New South Wales \\nDepartment of Primary Industry and other State Government \\nDepartments of Agriculture have been working to eradicate \\nand prevent the further spread of the mite. Eradication, \\nsurveillance and buffer zones have been established and \\nstandstill orders are in force for the movement of hives. \\nAuthorities are confident that eradication is achievable. 35\\nBega Cheese Limited 2022 Sustainability ReportThe La Niña weather pattern in Australia \\nresulted in significant rainfall this year. \\nFloods in Queensland, New South Wales, \\nSouth Australia and parts of Victoria \\noccurred between December 2021 and \\ninto June 2022. Major storm events along \\nAustralia’s East Coast in February and \\nMarch saw 23 lives tragically lost and \\nestimated financial losses of around \\n$2.5 billion. These events disrupted milk \\nsupply and caused minor damage to this \\nyear’s peanut crop. Farmers in the Mary \\nValley in Queensland received more than \\none metre of rain in five days, resulting in \\nthe highest flood level in the Mary River in \\n100 years. Fortunately, stock losses were \\nrelatively low but there was significant \\ndamage to fences, laneways, irrigation \\ninfrastructure, crops and pastures.\\nWe adopted a “safety first” approach \\nacross our supply chain to ensure the \\nwellbeing of employees and business \\npartners. Most farms were able to \\ncontinue milking with production losses \\nof around 20% of most flood-impacted \\nfarms. In some regions affected by storm \\ndamage and power outages, we sourced \\ngenerators to help farmers continue \\nmilking. Where we could not collect milk \\ndue to infrastructure damage and road \\nclosures, we paid farmers for their milk.\\nThe Better Farms Program funded field \\nvisits to impacted farms to advise \\non wet weather management issues \\nand recovery strategies. This included managing animal welfare challenges such \\nas lameness and mastitis management \\nassociated with wet weather and \\ndisruptions to farm practices. We made \\nfunding available under the Program \\nfor capital works grants and to repair \\ninfrastructure. To improve preparedness \\nfor future events, the installation of \\nback up generators has been elevated \\non the priority order of Capital Works \\nProjects. Back up generators will enable \\ncows to be milked and minimise adverse \\nanimal welfare outcomes resulting \\nfrom prolonged power outages.\\nWe also donated products to Food \\nBank and the Red Cross Evacuation \\nCentre and sourced refrigerators for \\nflood affected areas in Queensland.

While we are proud of this product, \\nwe still need to import peanuts to meet demand across our \\nbroader product portfolio. Two-thirds of the edible peanuts \\nconsumed in Australia are imported. As The Great Australian \\nFood Company, increasing the Australian peanut crop is \\nimportant to our business, our customers and to the broader \\nAustralian agriculture sector. We’re now Australia’s leading \\nsupplier of peanuts from our sites at Kingaroy and Tolga in \\nQueensland. While favourable weather has played a part, we \\nhave been able to increase the peanut harvest over the past \\ntwo years. In FY2020 the harvest was approximately 8,000 \\nmetric tonnes, increasing to 22,509 metric tonnes in 2021 \\nand an estimated 23,000 metric tonnes for the 2022 season \\nfrom growers in Queensland and Northern New South Wales.\\nPeanut production has generally moved into irrigated \\nregions, such as Bundaberg, in recent years. However, \\nthe increased rainfall associated with the La Niña \\nweather pattern in FY2022 has seen an increase in \\nproduction in dryland areas such as Burnett where the \\ncrop tonnage increased by 8% on the previous year. \\nOur Farming Services Team of eight staff provides peanut \\ngrowers with agronomic advice in the field, and training \\non growing conditions and new varieties. Our Grower \\nAdvisory Group includes grower representatives from \\neach of our major regions. They meet quarterly and while \\nthey help in our communications, they also advocate \\nand raise concerns on behalf of peanut growers. \\nOur Peanut Breeding Program is a collaboration between \\nBega Group and the Grains Research Development \\nCorporation (GRDC). The program aims to develop new \\npeanut varieties with a focus on improving yield, pest \\nresistance and decreasing costs of production. Our Peanut \\nGrowing and Breeding Committee reports directly to our \\nBoard and oversees the ongoing research and development \\nof new peanut varieties to benefit our peanut growers. \\nWe continue to work with peanut growers to ensure that \\nthe use of any chemicals and fertilisers can be traced back \\nto the paddock. Growers must provide a Declaration and \\nChemical Use Record to us prior to payment for peanut \\ncrops, which includes the use of any Australian Pesticides \\nand Veterinary Medicines Authority registered chemicals.Sourcing \\nAustralian \\ngrown \\npeanuts\\nIncreased our \\nAustralian peanut \\ncrop from \\napproximately \\n8,000 metric \\ntonnes to an \\nestimated 23,000 \\nmetric tonnes \\nin two yearsFigure 14: Area of peanut production by growing regionOur Peanut Farming Services team is \\npartnering with the CRC for Developing \\nNorthern Australia and CQ University, \\nto test the use of the peanut crop as \\nlivestock feed. The project is evaluating \\ndifferent peanut varieties from our \\npeanut breeding program. While these \\nvarieties have proven to be good nut \\nproducers, they also produce large \\namounts of biomass which can be used \\nto feed livestock. This may provide two \\nincome streams for peanut growers \\n– one from early season fodder and \\nanother when the peanuts mature to \\nharvest.

Our Wellness Portal on the Bega Group intranet \\ncommunicates our health and wellbeing programs. Having \\nlaunched our Calm Healthy Minds program last year, we have \\nsince established a mental health committee to support \\nleaders in having conversations around mental health. \\nOur BegaFlex policy is available to all of our employees \\nacross Australia. For those roles where it is possible, the \\npolicy allows employees to work from a safe and productive \\nwork location outside of their usual workplace, arrange \\ndifferent work schedules, job and role sharing and paid or \\nunpaid leave arrangements to support the balance and \\nwellbeing of employees inside and outside of working \\nlife. The policy is supported by a set of principles and \\nfocuses on trust, achievement and win win outcomes.\\nEmployee engagement\\nThe Bega Q12 is our tool to measure engagement. The survey, \\npowered by Gallup, is run twice a year and consists of 12 core  \\nquestions to help us understand the existing level of employee \\nengagement. The results generate conversations and facilitate \\naction. Launched in November 2018 with our salaried employees, \\nwe have since experienced growth in participation rates to \\n86% and the engagement index, seeing it increase steadily \\nfrom 1.87 to 5.75. Gallup recommends an engagement index \\nof 4 to counteract the effects of actively disengaged team \\nmembers. Bega Group’s strengths are highlighted by Question \\n5 Someone at work cares about me as a person and Question \\n10 I have a Best Friend at work are regular strengths which \\nreflect our people living our value of Support Each Other.Diversity and inclusion\\nOur commitment to diversity and inclusion is formalised  \\nin the Bega Cheese Diversity and Inclusion Policy, updated  \\nin July 2021. This policy will be formally reviewed again in  \\nJuly 2023. Our Bega Group value of support each other \\nreflects the behaviours important to becoming more diverse \\nand inclusive. Specifically, we act with humility, respect and \\nempathy towards others and look out for each other. We are \\ninclusive, network and help each other to make a difference.\\nThe Bega Diversity and Inclusion strategy provides an \\noverarching framework and action plan for the development of \\ngoals, targets and priorities and against which we can measure \\nour success. Our strategy is based on three pillars: fostering \\ninclusive leadership, supporting working families and developing \\nwomen leaders. A review of the gender pay gap is undertaken \\nannually and Bega Group introduced site-based diversity \\nand inclusion teams last year. These teams have been able \\nto identify issues of disparity and barriers to advancement \\nopportunities as well as remedies which can be tailored to \\nspecific sites. We will commence public reporting on the ratio \\nof female to male salaries in the FY2023 Sustainability Report.\\nAt the end of June this year, we signed on to the 40:40 Vision \\nwhich is an investor-led initiative to achieve gender balance in \\nexecutive leadership across all ASX300 companies by 2030. \\nLed by HESTA, 40:40 stands for 40% women, 40% men and \\n20% any gender. Our next step over the coming year is to set \\npublicly available and time bound composition targets for \\nthe representation of women in executive leadership roles \\nfor 2024 and 2027. This includes making a pledge to achieve \\ngender balance in executive leadership by 2030, publishing \\nthe plan to get there and reporting annually on our progress. \\nThe plan will be available on our website in June 2023.\\nBringing greater diversity into our organisation is the first step. \\nThe next step is creating the right conditions where people \\nfeel willing and able to contribute and be their best selves \\nat work. Our leaders are in a strong position to influence the \\nclimate in which the business operates and improve the \\nconditions our teams work in to be more inclusive. In October \\n2021 we started the Bega Group Inclusive Leader Coaching \\nSeries, developed to support an understanding of inclusion for \\nleaders at Bega. The series featured ten, fortnightly interactive \\nworkshops focusing on the development of key skills and \\nattributes for inclusive leaders.

A \\ncircular economy is one in which business and the community \\nwork together to optimise the use of resources and ensure \\nproducts are manufactured from renewable sources or are \\ndesigned for reuse before being repurposed or remade for \\nalternate use. The aim is to optimise the use of all resources \\nso there is minimal waste and natural processes and \\necological systems are enhanced, improving the resilience \\nof our regional communities. The program will identify, \\naccelerate and implement 9 enabling projects, supporting the \\ndelivery of 15 flagship and 29 circular projects to stimulate \\na regional circular marketplace and a vibrant community \\nof diverse stakeholders and healthy ecological systems.The program concept started with our partners, KPMG and \\nRabobank, working to apply circularity principles to our operating \\ncontext. The program adopts a multi-stakeholder approach \\nwith a community focus which includes direct engagement with \\ngovernment agencies, universities, private sector, farmer groups, \\nnon-government organisations and the indigenous community. A \\nSteering Committee was formed in October 2020 and includes \\nrepresentatives from: Bega Cheese, Rabobank, KPMG, Addisons, \\nDepartment of Regional NSW, Bega Valley Shire Council, AACo, \\nCharles Sturt University, the University of Wollongong and \\nNSW Local Land Services. The Steering Committee meets on \\na regular basis to review funding and project opportunities \\nand engage with community stakeholders.

These \\noutline our commitment to reducing our environmental impacts, \\nprotecting the environment and reducing pollution. These \\npolicies will be reconciled into a single policy in FY2023. \\nBega Group operates in accordance with significant \\nCommonwealth legislation relevant to our organisation. \\nThese include the Environment Protection and Biodiversity \\nConservation Act 1999, the National Greenhouse and Energy \\nReporting Act 2007, the Clean Energy Act 2011, the Recycling and \\nWaste Reduction Act 2020 and National Environment Protection \\nMeasures. A number of our sites report to the Commonwealth \\ngovernment’s National Pollutant Inventory (NPI) on emissions to \\nair, ranging from sulphur dioxide to volatile organic compounds. \\nWe also operate in accordance with various environmental \\nprotection regulations associated with State legislation which \\nregulates, controls and manages impacts on the environment. \\nThese include the Environment Protection Act 1997 (ACT), the \\nEnvironmental Management and Pollution Control Act 1994 \\n(Tasmania), Environment Protection Act 1993 (South Australia), \\nEnvironment Protection Act 2017 (Victoria), the Protection \\nof the Environment Operations Act 1997 (New South Wales), \\nEnvironmental Protection Act 1986 (Western Australia)  \\nand the Environmental Protection Act 1994 (Queensland).  \\nBega Group did not receive any fines for non-compliance  \\nwith environmental laws or regulations in FY2022.\\nIn FY2022, Bega Group reported compliance activities \\nto environmental regulators and water authorities. \\nMost notifications have been successfully resolved \\nwith the appropriate regulator during the year and no \\nfines have been issued. Specifically, Bega Group:\\n• Received one minor notice from South East Water in Chelsea, \\nVictoria which was resolved without further action.\\n• Received one Direction Notice from the Tablelands Regional \\nCouncil to the Peanut Company of Australia regarding dust \\ncomplaints at the Tolga Factory in Queensland, which is  \\nin progress.\\n• Reported five wastewater breaches against waste trade \\nagreements - two at Penrith, New South Wales and three  \\nat the Vegemite Way site in Victoria.

Scope 1 emissions are a \\ndirect result of activities at facilities such as gas fired boilers \\nand dryers. Scope 2 emissions result from the generation \\nof purchased electricity. Intensity targets help inform our \\ninvestment pipeline and process improvements in our supply \\nchain. We have adopted a Carbon Reduction Program 2030 \\nand we will also explore formal engagement with the SBTi. \\nFor some time now, Bega has been investing in our manufacturing \\nfacilities to improve energy efficiency and reduce our carbon \\nfootprint. Following the announcement of our greenhouse gas \\nemission targets in 2021, we have established a carbon steering \\ngroup and a series of new programs to help understand our \\nbaseline activity and where opportunities exist to enable \\nreductions off our 2021 baseline. This will help inform priorities \\nfor investment and provide a framework for how we engage the \\nmarket to support our 2030 goals. In the 2021 Sustainability \\nReport, we provided an overview of the analysis that was \\nperformed across Bega Cheese production facilities to identify \\ninitiatives that could save energy and reduce emissions \\nthrough efficiency and electrification. During FY2022 we \\nengaged a third party to commence a review into improved \\nmetering data at three of the Bega Dairy and Drinks sites, \\nwith a further investment expected in future years. Improving \\nthe baseline data will allow us to identify the highest impact \\nefficiency opportunities and pipeline for future investment. We \\nrecognise the importance of moving to renewable energy as \\npart of our greenhouse gas reduction program. During FY2021, \\nwe engaged a third party to conduct a study on electricity \\nconsumption across the network to help inform our renewable \\nenergy program. Following this review, we issued a request for \\ninformation to a number of potential future service providers \\nin relation to “behind-the-meter” solar. This will help Bega \\nGroup understand the potential for an investment in solar \\ninfrastructure on a number of our manufacturing facilities and \\nwarehouses and will be assessed in FY2023. We will explore \\nfurther opportunities to convert to renewable energy through \\nPower Purchase Agreements or other arrangements.To support our carbon reduction efforts, we continued to \\nimplement our Energy Management Capability (EMC) program \\nwhich started with a Bega Cheese Energy reduction Roadmap \\nin FY2018. This was followed by a program of sub-metering \\nand monitoring to identify energy efficiency opportunities and \\nplan and implement projects. We invested $1.12 million on the \\nimplementation of energy efficiency projects and $800,000 \\nin new metering installations to monitor electricity, gas and \\nsteam and to provide greater visibility and accountability of \\nour energy use and carbon emissions. Our Port Melbourne \\nsite at Vegemite Way achieved a reduction in energy use of \\n6.8% as a result implementing a project with a simple pay \\nback period of less than two years.

Scope \\n3 emissions are those generated by activities outside of \\nBega’s direct control that are incurred within Bega’s value \\nchain, on farms and in transport for example. They include \\ngreenhouse gas emissions associated with the products and \\nservices that Bega Group procures (other than electricity) \\nand emissions generated in the transportation, use and \\ndisposal of Bega’s products and management of waste.\\nWe have undertaken an initial estimate using guidance provided \\nby the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, the world’s most widely used \\ngreenhouse gas accounting standards. Our estimate was derived \\nby applying emissions factors to Bega specific activity data for \\nthe FY2021 period associated with purchases, distribution of \\ngoods, waste management, employee travel, and the processing \\nof our products. This analysis highlighted that scope 3 emissions are the largest component of our total greenhouse gas footprint. \\nEmissions associated with the raw materials, ingredients and \\ntransportation services we procure are our most significant \\nsource. More than 90% of our total emissions are scope 3. \\nMilk and the emissions generated in dairy farming are clearly \\nthe greatest single source of our scope 3 emissions.\\nWe have commenced an engagement program with \\nsuppliers to highlight our growing focus on our material \\nsupply chain emissions. The initial priority is to understand \\nthe progress our suppliers have made in addressing their \\nown greenhouse gas emissions, source data to assist with \\nongoing scope 3 measurement and to identify potential \\nscope 3 emissions reduction opportunities. Our intention \\nis that these initial conversations will provide a basis for \\nan ongoing scope 3 collaboration program involving our \\nsuppliers, customers and other relevant stakeholders.\\nFigure 23: Understanding Bega Group’s scope 3 emissions \\nScope 3\\n Scope 2 Scope 1\\n Scope 3\\n Scope 3\\n Scope 3\\nSuppliers and primary producers Processing Distribution Customers Consumers\\nDistribution Farm machinery Processing (Electricity) Processing (Gas) Distribution Customers – own brand End user  \\nPackaging Crops, (nitrogen) Owned logistics \\nsitesRefrigerants - CFC Freight Retail customers Waste - recycled\\nDairy cattle \\n(methane)Leased logistics \\nsitesExport markets Landfill Waste\\nHospitality  \\nInputsProducer \\n(Supplier)Processing Distribution \\n(Supplier)Customer  2.85%\\nScope 1\\n90.54%\\nScope 36.61%\\nScope 2\\n 56\\nBega Cheese Limited 2022 Sustainability Report Our PlanetFigure 24: Bega Group’s Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions in FY2021\\nFigure 25: Bega’s top 10 purchased products and services by emissions (% of scope 3/tCO2e) Footnote 8\\n8This includes scope 3 categories 1,2 and 4 – purchased goods & services, capital goods, transport & distribution8.5%\\nMilk components6.6%\\nLogistics 4.8%\\nCheese 2.1%\\nPeanuts\\n0.9%\\nBottles\\n0.8%\\nFruit\\n0.7%\\nCapital\\n0.7%\\nCartons\\n0.6%\\nSite labour69.5%\\nMilkThis year we launched our Planet Pledge, \\nsetting targets for water reduction, \\nwaste reduction and packaging to sit \\nalongside our climate commitments. \\nAll the targets are underpinned by the \\nprinciple of circularity which aims to \\nminimise waste, circulate materials at \\ntheir highest value and regenerate nature.Case Study\\nBEGA’S PLANET \\nPLEDGE FOR \\nGREATER GOOD\\nPLANET\\nPLEDGE\\nCLIMATECIRCULARITY30% reduction \\nin water use WATER\\nThat’s enough \\nto fill 400 Olympic \\nswimming poolsby 2030PACKAGING\\nAll packaging \\nto be reusable, \\nrecyclable or \\ncompostable\\nby 2025That’s about \\nthe weight of \\n60 steel \\nmilk silos\\nZero waste \\nto landfill WASTEThat’s about 542 garbage \\ntrucks* less waste in 2025 \\nby 2025* based on 9.5 tonne truck\\nThat’s nearly 100,000 \\nPerth to London one-way \\nflights worth of C02Net Zero Carbon \\nby 2050\\nand at least \\n40% emissions \\nreduction \\nby 2030\\n 57\\nBega Cheese Limited 2022 Sustainability Report 58\\nBega Cheese Limited 2022 Sustainability Report Our PlanetWater Management\\nOur aim is to reduce our consumptive water use by 30% by 2030  \\nbased on FY2021 water use.

This \\nbuilds on work already undertaken at the Wetherill Park site  \\nlast year which saved 86 megalitres of water in FY2021 and the \\nKoroit site in FY2020 which reduced demand on town water by \\n200-300 kilolitres a day. Our Lagoon Street site in Bega has \\nsaved 18% of total water between FY2015 and FY2020, conserving  \\nmore water resources for the Bega community’s town water supply.While water consumption across the Bega Group decreased in \\nrecent years, 30% of our manufacturing sites are located in  \\nareas of high or extremely high water stress. Our manufacturing  \\nsites aim to improve water efficiency and are focused on \\nreducing water intake, water collection, increasing the re-use of \\nwater and finding alternatives for efficient resource processing.\\nBega Group’s overall data on water consumption, \\nwastewater generation and water re-use is detailed \\nin the performance data table in Appendix B.\\nWater withdrawal by source (Megalitres)\\nWastewater generation (Megalitres)Figure 26: Bega Group water withdrawal for manufacturing by source\\nFigure 27: Bega Group wastewater generatedFY2021 FY2020 FY2022301\\nGround water69\\nSurface water3,748\\n3,378\\nMunicipal water Total withdrawal311\\n843,601\\n3,206\\n2791183,694\\n3,296\\nFY2021 FY2020 FY2022301\\nGround water69\\nSurface water3748\\n3378\\nMunicipal water Total withdrawal311\\n843601\\n3206\\n2791183694\\n3296\\nFY2020\\nEfﬂuent discharge9294,016\\nReused waterFY20218583,806\\nFY20228613,783 59\\nBega Cheese Limited 2022 Sustainability Report Our PlanetProducing More, \\nWasting Less.\\nUnderstanding how raw materials and natural resources are used \\nat our food processing sites will help us to identify opportunities \\nto recover and repurpose them. We have expanded our scope \\nto monitor a wider range of waste streams to gather information \\non how materials may be diverted away from landfill and retain \\nmore of their value to our business or those of commercial and \\nother partners. Our Lagoon Street site in Bega generated revenue \\nby processing mineral whey concentrate into product, instead \\nof releasing minerals to the environment through wastewater.\\nRecent challenges in the global food supply chain and concerns \\nregarding food security more broadly has increased interest and \\nfocus on how food is lost or wasted in the value chain. Australians \\nwaste around 7.6 million tonnes of food annually. While this \\nrepresents 3% of Australia’s annual greenhouse gas emissions, it \\nalso represents 2,600 gigalitres of water used to grow that food9. \\nBega Group has a significant role in reducing food loss and \\nwaste in the Australian dairy sector. Losses can occur on \\nfarms, in factories and distribution, as well as through retail \\nand consumption. Dairy Australia is partnering with Stop Food \\nWaste Australia and the Australian Dairy Products Federation \\nto create a Dairy Sector Food Waste Action Plan to support \\nthe Australian dairy industry’s public commitment to halve \\nfood waste by 2030. Bega Group and other manufacturers \\nare sharing their insights regarding food waste types, causes, \\nlocations, current disposal methods and proposed interventions. \\nUnder our Planet Pledge, our aim is for zero waste to landfill. \\nOur rate of solid waste diversion from landfill this year for \\nBega Group was 97%. In FY2021, our site in Salisbury, South \\nAustralia, achieved zero waste-to-landfill and we plan to learn \\nfrom that and repeat that success over the next few years. Packaging – circular economy \\nfor a better planet\\nReducing the environmental impact of our packaging while \\nmaintaining food safety and integrity is vital to us as a food \\nproducer. Bega Group procured more than 47,000 tonnes of \\npackaging in FY2022. We support Australia’s National Packaging \\nTargets adopted in 2018 and are active participants in the \\nAustralian Packaging Covenant Organisation (APCO) which \\nhas been charged by government to facilitate the delivery \\nof the targets. This is an important step towards a circular \\neconomy for packaging. We also participate in Dairy Australia’s \\nIndustry Working Group for Sustainable Packaging (IWGSP) \\nwhich aims to identify sustainable packaging opportunities \\nand progress industry collaboration towards collectively \\nmeeting the 2025 National Packaging Targets. The work \\nof the group is guided by the Australian Dairy Sustainable \\nPackaging Roadmap to 2025, developed by APCO, Dairy \\nAustralia and the Australian Dairy Products Federation.\\nOur target is for 100% of our packaging to be reusable, \\nrecyclable or compostable by 2025. This includes:\\n• Maximizing the recycled content included in \\npackaging by 2025.\\n• Phasing out of problematic and unnecessary \\nsingle use plastic packaging by 2025.\\n• Adopting Australasian Recycling Label (ARL) logos  \\nto provide consumer clarity, increase the recovery  \\nor recycled materials and maximize the amount \\nof packaging recycled nationally.\\nFigure 28: Bega Group solid waste landfill diversion rate97%82.5%\\nFigure 29: Bega Group total packaging by weight which \\nis reusable, recyclable or compostable\\n9National Food Waste Strategy Feasibility Study Final Report 2021 60\\nBega Cheese Limited 2022 Sustainability Report Our Planet\\nOur focus is on increasing the recycled content in our \\npackaging and increasing the recyclability of our packaging. \\nTo do this, we integrate packaging considerations into \\nour product development process. In FY2022, more than \\n82% of our total packaging was recyclable and nearly \\n27% of our packaging included recycled content. \\nToday 100% of our Vegemite packaging is recyclable.  \\nOn the back of the launch of our Vegemite Squeezy bottle  \\nlast year, we launched our Simply Nuts peanut butter in a  \\nShake ‘n’ Squeeze bottle made from at least 30%  \\npost-consumer recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET)10 . \\nThis year we completed our phase out of polyvinyl chloride \\n(PVC) from our packaging altogether. The team at our Ridge \\nStreet factory in Bega, New South Wales worked with our \\ncustomer to replace PVC cheese slice clamshell packaging with \\nup to 30% post-consumer rPET. The rPET is sourced from pre \\nand post-consumer material waste sources and is cleaned, \\nsterilised and recycled through food contact approved recycling \\nequipment. Starting with a trial in November 2020, the new \\npackaging was rolled out to all of the customer’s stores  \\nat the end of 2021. Our next step is to increase the post-consumer  \\nrPET from 30% to 50%, with a view to achieving 100% \\npost-consumer rPET by 2025. In the coming year, we will \\nlaunch a 100% rPET bottle for our Juice Brothers brand.\\nIn 2021 Bega Group became a partner of the REDcycle \\nprogram which is a product stewardship model where \\nmanufacturers, retailers and consumers share responsibility \\nto reduce plastic packaging going to landfill. We use this \\nplatform to support the recycling of our post-consumer \\nflexible plastics, for example yoghurt pouches, cheese \\nouter wraps and plastic sleeves such as Zooper Dooper.100%   \\nof our Vegemite \\npackaging is recyclable\\nPhased out PVC \\npackaging completely\\nNearly \\n27%  \\nof our packaging includes \\nrecycled content\\n82.5%   \\nTotal packaging \\nby weight which is \\nreusable, recyclable or \\ncompostable\\n10Excluding the bottle cap 61\\nBega Cheese Limited 2022 Sustainability Report Our PlanetREAD MORE\\nTHE REDCYCLE \\nPROGRAMREAD MORE\\nAUSTRALIA’S \\nNATIONAL \\nPACKAGING \\nTARGETS, \\nAPCO\\nREAD MORE\\nCopies of the full report \\nand summary report \\nAUSTRALIAN \\nDAIRY \\nSUSTAINABLE \\nPACKAGING \\nROADMAPREAD MORE\\nOUR ANNUAL \\nREPORT AND \\nACTION PLAN 62\\nBega Cheese Limited 2022 Sustainability ReportAPPENDIX A: Data Boundary\\nData included in Sustainability Report FY 2022\\nEntities in Consolidated \\nFinancial Statement in 2022\\nOwnership (%)\\nSupply chain\\nFood Safety \\nNutrition\\nWorkforce\\nSafety\\nEnergy\\nCarbon\\nWater\\nWastewater\\nWaste\\nPackaging\\nBega Cheese Ltd (Parent) P P P P P P P P P P11P\\n180 Nutrition Pty Ltd 100 O O P O O O O O O O P\\nBDD Australia Pty Ltd 100 P P P O P O O O O O P\\nBDD Foods Pty Ltd 100 P P P P P O O O O O P\\nBDD Milk Pty Ltd 100 P P P P P P P P P P P\\nBega Cheese Benefit Fund Ltd 100 O O O O O O O O O O O\\nBega Cheese \\nInvestments Pty Ltd100 O O O O O O O O O O O\\nBega Dairy and Drinks Pty Ltd 100 P P P P P P P P P P P\\nBega Dairy and Drinks \\nFinance Pty Ltd100 O O O O O O O O O O O\\nBega Dairy and Drinks (NZ) Ltd 100 O O O O O O O O O O O\\nBega Dairy and Drinks \\nServices Pty Ltd100 P O O P P O O O O O P\\nBega Insurance Pte Ltd 100 O O O O O O O O O O O\\nBerri Pty Ltd 100 P P P P P P P P P P P\\nBerri Asia Sdn Bhd 100 P O P O O O O O O O P\\nBlowflex Mouldings Pty Ltd 100 P O O P P P P P P P P\\nCapitol Chilled Foods \\n(Australia) Pty Ltd100 P P P P P P P P P P P\\nDairy & Drinks Singapore Pte Ltd 100 O O P O O O O O O O O\\nDairy Farmers Pty Ltd 100 P P P O P O O O O O P\\nDairy Vale Foods Pty Ltd 100 P P P O O O O O O O P\\nMalanda Dairyfoods Pty Ltd 100 P P P P P O O O O O P\\nNational Foods Holdings Ltd 100 P P P O P O O O O O P\\nNational Foods Beverage \\nHoldings Pty Ltd100 P P P O P O O O O O P\\nPeanut Company of \\nAustralia Pty Ltd100 P P P P P P P P P P P\\nQUD Pty Ltd 100 P P P O O O O O O O P\\nShanghai Great Lion Food & \\nBeverages Management Co Ltd100 O O P O O O O O O O O\\nTatura Milk Industries Pty Ltd 100 P P P P P P P P P P P\\nTatura Cheese Industires Pty Ltd 100 P P P O O O O O O O P\\nVitasoy Australia Products Pty Ltd12 49 O O O O P O O O O O O\\nCBH Fresh Ltd 13.7 O O O O O O O O O O O\\n11Excludes Maffra depot facility \\n12Performance data on the Vitasoy Australia Pty Ltd joint venture is detailed in Vitasoy International \\nHoldings Sustainability Report at www.vitasoy.com/sustainability/reporting 63\\nBega Cheese Limited 2022 Sustainability ReportAPPENDIX B: Performance Data \\nSustainability Report People Data (1/07/21 -
